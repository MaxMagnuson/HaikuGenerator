Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with
straight-jackets and robes,
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globel
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly?, feel this...

I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall!
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presents
Slug a bolt one ceremonies of merit turned blood sport (Uh)
Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumpin' out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves
DUNCED
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the wookie walk, hawkin'
Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
the point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics, see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like, bully to knuckle duster
And a scent, your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire, dance a jig around a pig
Figurin' yea, I'll lend a plan on leaked fame trackers
Using only the finest in post-modern terrain mappers
Once my brethren disperse...
My God, you'd think the heaven's touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
But I don't, confide why to choose me.
Bored, lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me

OK I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies,
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes...
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell,
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics...

Now someone's approached the roach, shaking like snow-globes
Other sort safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (yeah)
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me
See, there's a time when... rhyme and...
Pain combine can't even manage to tell what the swell is, like
Picture your imagery embellished with the hellish aspects of the swarm's forlorn facets

Soul crafted fat cats, burrowin', left perennial tenants discouraged in
Discussin' my four-season flourishing, Uh!
Surgeon purging poetic lead poison
Poised, in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride
I'm a, animated style machine in
a veening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify bottom genus species and class start to chuckle...
Buckle the architecture til it fell through.
Kill the survivors, then raise the dead for shock value
By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (yeah I'll...)
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated

So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like "Boo" Radley
Radically we consume the Colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting

I live for the moment of truth when Big Willy rapper
ackgnowledges failure and states 'Goddamn my shit is trash'
'It's time to let go', the tin man bangin' upon his chest to hear the echo:
'Heartless kid, hollow compartments'
Be we the people of the united, starving artistic
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
I'm clueing into the poison panoramics brewed in panic situations
It fucks a little with my brittle gift
I tell myself 'Stay' (Stay)... up high
make a mockery of sun, and moon, and star
'til they hand over the sky
My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is
Invade the town while village elders holler 'Who the fuck's this?'
He hip a cats, agravated trudge through the muds
Quickin' ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood
Rugged serpentines climb, pebble the rock
Let your pretty, pink cloud nine expectations please you not
I'm, Ae-fuckin'-sop Rock, mic bizarro.
Proper application of the soul by my standard.
Candid once position from which instigations spawn
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like
Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope... 

Wake up, wake up
Ayo Percee P, it's time to wake these kids up

Word up Aesop Rock, they'd better take their fingers off
pause and hit record

Is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails tell my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, I'm a
Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sing to the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present
Normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotations of the tables to label the opposition
As I choose, refusing to evolve with the cold
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Brain trip the Beta weights, trap for the slaughter
Like livestock infected with anthrax
On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
Where the bluest ribbons yield the glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
Slave to idiot box revalations
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestle your whole vessel fell to pieces
And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family
I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
My mic stabs white flags and drags trembling,
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
Once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
Available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion
99 brilliant new dimensions, bust it

I'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging
50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon
Huh, I know this nigga named Rickey his girl Nikki want to get with me
Says "Stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie"
I stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads
One look and said I ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead
You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides
And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
One verse, lung burst, as I done first
Guns, slums, hearse don't stun Perce, where I'm from's worse (sucker)
My new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot
Then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot
Stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine
Leave you back in time and I'll be there still ain't at my prime
I'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild
I turn the dial, niggas stealing my style
I should file for reparations

Four rooms, a ceiling and a floor but there's more:
(close to insanity)
A desk with a subtle light, a window, and a door;
(close to insanity)
One bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw;
(close to insanity)
One child prodigy with a vision in his core.
(close to insanity)

(yeah, yo)
I'm frost bitten, slippin' away in titanic burden nurses
Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service
And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh,
Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath. (Breath)
These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash,
Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak.
Malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow;
I'm shook in a freak side show!
OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink
So I design this chorus line.
When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall.
With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage,
Then see the wide-eyed dry grays, and supplied fiery Colossus.
Well, I am a hostage. Guiding, yet, pushed beneath the crazes' climate.
Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this.
I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity.
God damn. Must have remembered me.
It clinched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it,
Apprehended me, and rendered me suspended in its voyage.
How these tables have turned!
Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label,
Sip the ladle. Drank the burn. Begging for dead!
Concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web,
Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled.
OK, OK, I get it...
Let 'em shake a little, then release 'em,
Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion.
Odium, patience ran his anti-death commando
Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil,
but couldn't quite catch the angle.
I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper
So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched, come on...

(yeah, yeah, check it)

I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating.
(close to insanity)
The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing.
(close to insanity)
Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply:
(close to insanity)
I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
(close to insanity)

Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn,
By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes...
To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we,
For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug.
I don't wanna pull the plug...
Hug on my canteen like in a dream,
Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league,
I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed,
If the breed should have ever been bred. 'Nuff said...

Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon,
To emerge, or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge,
All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn
To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner.
Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king...
More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring.
Mood swingin' from the mezzanine level,
Here to bevel the edge.
My team's settled on the ledge to pledge.
It's like that.

In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains.
In the winter it's the same, with an added climate change.
The remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for midrange,
Yet the songs of thirst remain the same.
You could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor,
Hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem.
I never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh,
So do your magic, miracle worker, or I'll remain unimpressed.
For the flux, the fix, the famine,
For the fact that little Billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon,
I'd examined auto-pilot (right) when filibuster won... (yeah)
Concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement... (oh shit)
It's intriguing. Yet, I guess, I knew somewhere, something was leaking.
Now I honor instinct, delinquent.
Bring settler runaways, frayed boogie bastard clicks
To bypass glass stature, walking graff characters...
Militant dance split the sun and sip the filament...
Tracer. Vivisection is to lab rat primes;
They try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine.
He knew. He brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets,
Then sought off all trickery, bought off the public, and screamed victory!
Tunnel through the mite infested grillage and the rig
As fast as Aesop and his ten little fatigued fingers could dig,
trigger revenge, tip the goblet in the dirt, review my words,
spit in the puddle. Peace to fame, struggle the fuck out, and duck out.

(yeah, check, huh, uh)

Now, all hail defenders of the trash talk.
(close to insanity)
I was hidden, yet I slid in just to rip the mask off.
(close to insanity)
I'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds
(close to insanity)
So y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground!
(close to insanity)

(It's like that)

All right
I can hear the ocean in a shell, but,
for the life of me, I never heard your surges
more than raindrops in a well.
Paladin tribe, break beat elitists.
Element five, fully sold on operation,
jeopardised on my survival.
I will survive when sprayed by heavens liquid ammunition,
I'll survive when betrayed by my brethren's wicked ambitions,
I'll survive when grated with shut-eye sticky thickets and thorns,
born clutching a fistful.
It hurts: morbidly blissful,
forms spiraling.
Sovereigns bring the rise from the funnel;
a chorus line of blind crazes
tap the water, find the tunnel.

As skinny clique mechanics flock to block pick of the land,
we stretch the earth around the canvas
dragging stick in the sand
and pan the hell out!
Amid your tireless bold,
behold that iris spits clips
subtly on supremacy, therefore, blemishes me.
Oh, the treacherous penalty centers me, renders me vague,
skating slalom through this churning murder columns

I am not entirely trained to undo the shame,
and all I got's three pennies and a rusty mic unto my name,
unto my game, the father Siamese approach
to whose delinquent dichotomy
cops Emerald City in wonderous novelty.
Drink drum, sip a snare to spit a rigid sequence,
that's when freak sons Fade to Black,
like these pretty pink lungs, slugger.
Paper dolls facade as swash buckler. (yeah)
Bounty hunt the front to document the frosh cluster.
I am structure with a smoke ring, militant distinction
with a cloak-and-dagger stagger prime directive,
and all else burrows itself amongst drunken perspective. (c'mon)
Fade me. I flee the scene,
grippin' the missing link
like chain gang escapees.
(I'm sayin')
BUILD ME (me)
KILL ME (me)
We cadets hold determination
as property undeniably divine;
we leak passion for the noise.
There is not a track to cherish
from he who lacks merit.

And all I think about's the motion,
exerted to color mavericks alerted.
Herd a billion nervous lost child prodigies home to flourish.
Now taciturn facets burn open to yield malarkey navigator
when wrestled on fancy driftwood out the vessel
and I settle.
A conquest:
stamp it,
label it
fresh. (fresh)

I, in turn, apply policies which require intrinsic merit. (uh)
Try to wallow down these yellow bricks with yesterdays appendix on hold;
spot it like sky horizon, exposed to bar-codes.
Load your fantasy.
Interject a bad dream candidly,
blue in the face, through in the chase
between myself and fame's embrace.
Face engaging,
presence resonant with
chiaroscuro atmospheric traps
inhabit the land of denied clearance.
(yeeah)
Pigeon hold styles, drop similar.
The course the corpse patients
lacing non sequitur's that spittle off the chin. (spittle of the chin)
Upon the recognition, pilot soften up the grin
spinning me dizzy, cold. Bending my city to hold water.

Yeah, we got affiliates. Cadet merit and brilliance.
Clever corporal king-thing, crooked
I shrink, I sink into my book.
It's, like, fury blew the scaffolding askew,
and tainted curiosities allowed the freak show to continue.

Forty thieves received the cue: commence blending a plan (yeah and that was spooky)
and decorate the dusk like henna to hand.
We unknowingly sketched the pentagram by sending clans
of caffeinated couriers upon a quest to run the perfect circle around a star.

Bizarre pattern with a bad vibe
like Jafar to Aladdin;
pardon the carbon-based blaze
amongst the stagnant trend frenzy,
it offends me.
Wait, ain't it the liquid soul therapy?
I sip to grip a stationary pillar
yet we slipped these boogie nights,
sucked wattage from rookie lights.
Now you proud.
I'ma be there when you rush in,
just to touch the mushroom cloud.
Drink failure
Lord have mercy on their dreams...
pretty pixels tend to trickle down the screen.

Know what I mean? (I scream)
BUILD ME (me)
KILL ME (me)
We consider fresh soundplay we seek frighteningly close to extinct.,,
My life line is an assignment:
to feed the arts my spirit and to bleed merit

The conclusion is subtle:
Huddled amongst hermitic gutter-bugs,
peasants, and drunks,
junkies to critics,
sick dictators, haters,
kings to alley urchins,
monarchs, narcs to liars
circling the wild fires, (fires)
live wires; I tend to plan an action less than orderly
in, with an otherwise uncommonly primer to normalcy torn, (torn)
these trades fade as cadavers due to conflicting data matter.
First heard as remarkable is now labeled as unmarketable.

Damn, thorn in my side...
Now the high five hives despised from feedings of alien seedlings, retreating...
Burst the threshold, make the vessel capsize,
then the hollering's of buoyant survivors
treading evoke dreaded Leviathan!
Dead it.
Headed to crunch the world of MC etiquette
by dismantling mics prior to passing towards degenerates.
How do you like that settlement? You feel that?
A maverick like myself bottles the creativity
till the cocoon naturally peels back.

This little light of mine shines
at a hundred billion times
the magnitude of every star
within an ample sky sample.
I alerted
my sole crusaders
to trade the games;
prescribed them strict diets of DDT and Kelthane

It fester when ingested,
Glorious vellum
addressing helots to zealots,
to Jezebel's to hellish felons,
granted my span of attention is not what it used to be,
but most of y'all delinquents ain't amusing me no more...

Get Merit. 
(whats up this is Aesop Rock for wkcr, check it)

I traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status, to coast muted.
Finding the night train mildly therapeutic.
Rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings,
Beneath this puppet master pulling my strings,
Leaking smoke rings singing...
(God, despite what's measured is honestly magnificent)
Syndicate sold to children, building homes for my omnipotent platoons.
Nah I don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs,
Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms.
We bloomed the matter down to those most beautifully discrete,
Applying yesterdays models, stand obsolete amongst colossals (amongst colossals)
Comply not to enforce us, aborted claiming they came off.
Sort of stabbed them with the capital 'A' that sets my name off.

Sick of it all, Sick of the stall,
Sick of the thick, brick in the wall sob stories,
the falls, the tragic hate calls.
Shaking like magic eight balls, pausing to watch the vapors crawl.
My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls.
We lining up along against these great walls,
Circling analytical,
Rhetorical inquiries
yet x is not applicable, kid.
Your flash motto we as orphans repeated,
You talking concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated kid,
I'm heated.

Its flight of the intruder and we all fall down.
Conditions of never blends science with religion
Cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence,
But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense.
Well isn't that bewildering?
Drunken distortion and spit the filter in.
Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together and you never
Seen I, Aesop Rock, flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine,
I'm here to ride upon the night train...

(yeah wkcr 89.9 ... here for the night train ... whats up to my man
apex, kinetic, dj ely, baz, my man dub el on productions, the mighty Jer, my
man patrick, blockhead, mr roper, omega one, my man hates one, percy p
andre ... stay up ... its like that ... its big aesop rock signing off)

Check it, in a box marked "divinity", I trap the trinity
of honor, evolution, and serenity.
Pulled the reign into me,
Sorta? type hype oddities of style,
lost child prodigy intrigued,
fatigued by a suit and tie spy claiming post-Bonham? peacemakers
with the worlds ends calibrated in their briefcases
Case em when the sun bursts...
and the populace awaited my reply:
I spit a billion tiny, brilliant white lights into the sky.
When your last murmurs fade like colors in graff burners,
soon to be flustered and clustered in with comrade trash hurlers.
Color me a sideline observer, alerted not yet retreating
and the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing.
Penny for your reasoning, Doug, which luckily I ain't as blessed to hold your attendance
so I could slide my guided tenants on the one.
That drop in the bucket boogie begun,
brick in the wall installments draw a fallen performance.
Fifth element, critical endurance
kingpin allow only the murkiest swamp bot
to slip beneath the skin, this is Aesop
recording til your TDK stops
watch laboratory clone demotions dodge on natural hate crops.

With the bearers of the reptile smile
again and again, blendin' a friend with a fiend
lendin' a bended dream,
keen, cold, the straight soul drenched, temper
fuckin, back boogie, I'm a settler,
kids wanna know the Aesop Rock...
the off the top, prototype, straight Robocop.
If you're Quasimoto, and you're slomo to stop
ya rock bells, I block spells casted.
If you wanna straight flacid pass me towards... you
what? Kids wanna jet? 'Tis I, the 6 foot 4 space cadet
all up in you, kids wanna bend you back
so who's the next kid to rock upon the track?

Tell me is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails tell my steppin' got em sweatin' flashbacks.
I played a part of minesweeper clunkin' sneakers
in my sunken city defunked and apparently examinin' famine.
I'ma follow the strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe.
Sink through the track and think back.
When I was a boy, I employed styles exhausted by every lost child.
At present, normally I drill pillars of normalcy.
You're all cordially invited to accompany me
in rotations at the tables to label the opposition as I choose.
Refused to evolve with the cold.
Rapidly dissolve my involvement in a solvent of soul and rolled back.
My brain tripped the beta, waits, trap for the slaughter
like livestock infected with anthrax.
When my Compaq of clan snaps to lapse was the mandatory maze,
where the bluest ribbons yield the glory days,
I reside up on the opposite circuit in glorious dazes
where glorious hazes are grey,
spun through my array of operations
slave to idiot box revelations
that wrap tightly in a practice
with my colleagues and slackers...
straight 20,000 league mappers.
And the swelling increases...
Once the mortar hit the pestle,
your whole vessel fell to pieces...
And I laughed! I laughed for me and my starving art family.
I laughed candidly, your failures ampin' me to vamp fresh.
My mic stabs white flags and drags trembling,
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance.
When the day turns night, señoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress.
The all new and improved, poetically portable Aesop Rock!
Available in stores with my highly suggested parental discretion,
and 99 brilliant new dimensions, bust it...

Bust this, I forever wallow in glitches, grimly distributed by side effects
Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches, drenched!
Gridled between dense pillars of polar value lies
a grey so blueless it's got I fiendin for the sky.
Synthesized lies rise synthetic
Sittin' inside solidified plastics who's lateral burns germ compatible...
My firm's radically piloted, dodging a fire swiftly
Yellow brick stalker walking shifty...
I am but a prototype Metroid programmed to Holocaust style
while you're soakin' in the stages of denial.
Your petty soldiers stand fragile like Giacometti sculptures,
embedded in aromatic cultures. We's rock steady vultures
Plus I's the guise of rowin' a soul.
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles.
Berserk!
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it.
Stripping, color my passion mitigated...

Does it feel, you're the coward of the year?

I'm so laborious, bright,
Its a wreck in dire vocabulary,
Adversaries will commence to ignite like magnesium oxide, canned argon peroxide,
I'm hazardous, more poisonous than carbon monoxide,
Earning stacks gold sterling plaques from burning tracks,
Your learning that if your unconcerned with rap no turning back now,
Man I'll bomb you please from up in the trees
I'll freeze the season with a tighter squeeze than Aaron Cometbus

Hey yo, One heart plated with purely golden tiles,
Mixed with a little mischief behold style,
Load a back alley shiner liquid
Tomb raider with a most fertile assortment of spitting logic,
'Til lab rats gone colossus in the spotlight,
Now Aesop Rock be the handle while your breath control is tough, to breath along is not enough,
I correspond to a kick snare blind,
but share the passion with but a small percentage of the masses and their fashion

You got a feeling that you got me where you want me
I've wait within the palm of your hand
And you've got cartoons in the morning while I'm sleeping
I've just got dreams that I don't understand

Supply the checks, Known from Cali, Chi to Lex
My respect and styles some try to get, but die direct from the side affects,
You crave Perc cause I'm well equip with predicate
your too delicate for this fella flip kid you better get saved first,
called freaks give me no floor feet all sweet small peeks
cause my stocks exchange they bore street still the slick
kicking the illest hits who kill us quick when I build this?
Spit more rounds than Bruce Willis flicks
Ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes
supplied with step this God did years ago to grasp a taste
have to place them in a glass case and observe 'em from a Nasa space center with a mask on face
Coward of the year make others fear the way this brother is empowered
I am the bomb, dont try tampering with my brand of style could by stand,
the only witness is God's (this guy's) camera taping me

I'm here, Does it feel, You're the coward of the year?
I'm gone too far somebody pull me home, too gone, too far, too gone, too far

Sadly I withered a non-believer,
When pride covered this must lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth
form the frame of your demeanor?
I address but a rapidly lessoning portion of majors
dissolved in the abortion of creations new laborers,
Pilot burner riddle of trades, divinity, composers
and tunnel through and out of spite the anti hero dosage,
In a cradle I label the dreaded simulation we compile,
Tenents embeded within synthetic inclination
We have never dined on bait so when corrupt crooks
hook simple Samaritans' eyes buried in books,
shift on a badda datta sun moon merger to guard the difference,
The New York MC population dancing uncontrollable expansion,
I, cyclothymic pound dodger,
push a wooden nickel towards town squatter bother me not,
My wallow across the village drunk and mumbling in the streets,
'bout how an angel gets its wings with every blue note I release,
An angel gets its wings with every blue note I release?
Could this be lies? Cause I'm gonna spit cobalt 'til every angel flys,
I blew the operation set to clinch victor,
Walkie talkers turn awkward fixtures to complete the wicked mixture,
the fire and ice combination adjourns fresh,
I return with the last living specimen caressed,
When the earth is vacated and the populous cleared,
I'll be the last star fighter sipping a goblet of my tears 


"You can come, I'll leap right over
Any day you like
System 605, Union 91"

I forever wallow in glitches, grimly distributed by side effects
Consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches, drenched!
Gridled between dense pillars of polar value lies
a grey so blueless it's got I fiendin for the sky.
Synthesized lies rise synthetic
Sittin' inside solidified plastics who's lateral burns germ compatible...
My firm's radically piloted, dodging a fire swiftly
Yellow brick stalker walking shifty...
I am but a prototype Metroid programmed to Holocaust style
while you're soakin' in the stages of denial.
Your petty soldiers seem fragile like Giacometti sculptures,
embedded in aromatic cultures. We's rock steady vultures
Plus I's the guise of rowin' a soul.
My wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles.
Berserk!
Swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it.
Stripping, color my passion mitigated;
I'm Slipping...

You always seem like a small grey cat to me
Sleepin underneath the silvery moon...
Paws curled beneath your head
'til the sun came round just around noon.
And you would greet me, purring in your doorway,
Drawing up your tail around my hips
And I would go to your mouth wide open,
waitin' for my language to come from your lips...
And I move you.
And you like it.
Just enough
To let me.
But I hate you...
Cause you're lonely.
And you know how
To forget me...

For the love of my personal practice I reside
where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawl collides.
Slide fuel by the fury
Spun a ring around my honor
but the opulence took shelter in my horror.
Melancholy masquerade
Cast amongst the braiding of belligerence
and blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement.
I stay special agent till the sky falls
Reverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse

And your footsteps leading down the pathway
never seem to be quite like my own...
Your mind is smokey circles
it blinded me till I turned towards home...
And you would watch me far in the distance
hands held high above your head.
I only leave the territory when there's nothing left to be said.
And I move you.
And you like it.
Just enough
To let me.
But I hate you...
Cause you're lonely...
And you know how
To forget me...

"You can come, I'll leap right over"

I make music and connect color to canvas,
swoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits.
Landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace,
saw my planted leaf start burnin from the oustide in.
Meaning your clout lies thin;
Salt prep the blades prior to five phase in my ever changin underworld.
Serate a day to decorate a traitor
That sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
Follow my portion, I'm gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter.

"You can come, I'll leap right over
Any day you like
System 605, Union 91" 

It's like antisocial
hazardous portion organically nourished couraged to flourish and muses often
Lunged nicotine dream missing languorous
Caution we proclaim until brain's off like Sagittarius
Shield. Yield to the eye mescaline killer veals
Stonegates marching moodily until plural styles immaculated beautifully.
Rudely awoke.
Sing rumble blue conglomerates sucking up lung while brushing parasitic critics to my left side.
I test glide kamikaze crashed to thoughtless on my preface.
The therapeutic unit recommended.
Now slow-mo Quasimotos teeter on ringleader status while I spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus.
Sleepwalking the atlas after none. Trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain to one-oh-one.
Run to organize my mood like quarterize my wound and climb up.
Lovely samaritans line up like bar codes for a fraction of my factions.
The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
Amplified files collapsed in cacophonic conquest. My specs up.
More postille and docile insubordinance your phylum.
Chordata asylum swarmed your coordinates. Rush.
Must not sleep, must warn others.
I'll tourniquet your turbulence then trample on your stutters.
If I could displace every vagrant in America with traces of my character the Earth would be a more pitiful habitat.
With infinite acres of auto-cry eight can aid ya. Swung open the nomenclature to obscure wool-lock trickery. Pure

That's like fiending for a purpose.

Swept off your meridian. It's operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey.

Hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take them down, pass them round, rock them all. Bust it.
I'm forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
Sardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance.
Tsunami rain blast tipped off like origami frames and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter.
While slaves defy water, start roofing paper bags.
The magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melted triple glitches on your console.
I calibrate my mics prior to claim and shit is rockable.
Unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce.
While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils.
Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program.
Elegant, the overcast password cursed on a tactless bastard, catatonic until personal practice mastered. 

STUDENT ONE
Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade!
STUDENT TWO
Troops behind them, fifty men or more!

I target the cruks of all that's considered sin
The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin

Spell-bound man hunting hell-hound
Special investigations set king pin
Bounce and of course your happy

Axis pivotal point spun all to often
Now walk and spin cycle
Dug psychadelic syndrome jabs your abdomen
I'm adament with disperse and curse across
You're playing your chances broken branches
Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it
My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning
Magnetic field my metal mind driven
Threshold fresh coke crush and affect
Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate
The all absorbing metamorphing monument
Not that average once upon a glock, glock, glock
Dot, dot, dot, etcetera
The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina
Burning you back to immobile twitchin fetal position
Itching for what could have been if not for who

This is Aesop Rock
I'm with 50 million troops upon my side
Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates
One hand on my mic
While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk
My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone

Close encounters of the first kind
Contact cursed minds skies red
Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs
Over whim and worry flurried on your sidesteps
My pride treads thick
Utilize wide lens I slide strength in
Tell her gently we utilize mic like skeller
Tanky evidently all is not well
In a metra pot sell
Automatic hell habitat
Tainted polutin it's toxic to me
The melancholy-olly-oxygen free on the night watch
Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy
Radically millions morphing the orphans
Spitting distortion
Piteous portions lacked a guiding light
Overiding and striding through the night
Story army extends mics like dendrites
I blend life
Dark then gray shapes
Till the splays made illustrate my views on sanity
If you're feeling famished we are family
Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter
I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all
Night crawling audio visual veterans
Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans

Drastic measures took for defence

Blade runner, intima-dating figment in the minds of the malignant

Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted
Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks
Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
Vanished in gritty streets til' city seeks, sleep, head, rush
Scope, infra-red touched
Temple's the torment
Pressure point contact
Crush the dormant with missing links
Syncopate movement, Our troubled blockade ends but I'm blemished in the blueprint
Behold of the hideous
I'm assaulted by the anthems of the lesser
Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure
Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages
Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten
A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded
As Ace's hungered for upper handed plan strategy: strike force
Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams
A portrait of pillage
Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception
Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon

Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle
Ya'll spinnin if you tread before you think

Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire

Dear Colleague
I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter
It really does seem quite out of character
Although I have to admit it is quite funny
Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor
But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame
It really...

All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms
Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore
It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for
My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding
Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt
All through flood fire and drowning tied rapidly into humid winds
Lucid lens bend sigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays I prayed for days lacking discolouring
Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks
Walkers cross Battlestars I travel far my radar flips
Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
I try to spring clones leaving em like tendrils, that require,
More than a click-click five
While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles
Gathered in gutters
Type B-negative whirlpool
I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture
As still in dreams while empires fall apart

He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart
I'll never know of you
Emotion reads close encounters I run
The last classic example of a love of mic and sample
Trampled pride is resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory
Not a question of should I
But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources
Crafted by supreme forces
Seemingly dream catcher
Aesop Rock computer Hacker!
See you lack a dispatch to request back up
Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher russian robot recruits
We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude
I am waterfall
I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls
Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'

Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire

This young man is clearly a genetic throwback
He seems to be experiencing primeval urges and feelings which frankly
Unless we can terminate will contaminate others
And threaten entire structure of our society

You replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics
Miserable attempts result in miserable conclusions
Paragon pen dragon tactician on freeform
Then a comfortable silence try to combat cliques
That unexpected Sephotus cyclone shifts
Worked up you're shooken, jetted to the side
I stagger this vagabond wondering menstrual forms of phobia
Worst fear the terrace stricken muted
The roots of all evil I've rooted pinnacle
Poised with pride pouncing to break your stride, forsaken
Agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition
My intuition felt you slip up
You tripped alone what are you aiming for?
Or do you sus tries to classify your genus, distorted fetus
Evolve, type unsolved, you lack the malediction
Malleable martyrs get molded, then folded under pressure
Thou perceives a slaughter suspension
Bridge over troubled water drown, sound study intensive
My square drops two erasing lines like tetris
Relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement
Two sticks to burn basics the lie adjacent to my placement
On the game board, lunge forward and wind-up impaled by the same sword
Choose your weapon, stains splattered upon your flag
Taturag shielding the exterior inferior
Stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall
Admittedly suspicious, a decadence, your network's on hiatus
Permanent, provoked and choked upon the potency
The parrow be the penetrating agent pierce the insides
Why the cold sweats at midnight? Why the dim light?
Why are we staring at a true from the inside?
Why the pen slide with vigor on a put down?
Like while I put my foot down stomp your city
A-E-S-O-P scoping through the bur, opening minds behind the smirks

I've seen misery, I've seen disgust dust ridden ruins
Iron clad oracle test three COM unit disperse silently
Over confidence leads to irony
Plot twist full hardy Icarus shifted in facets of my form
Forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side
A storm upon the rise, Adam, I or crush come brush upon the red zone
Crook you're shook you started poorly
Your powers parted pace uncharted territory
Disoriented malicious god you'll burn your bridges
This craft requires first drafts
Graphs, gritted blueprints of nemesis perimeter
Hunting by night compute, twenty one mic salute
One life polluted, concerned muffle moans
From the nine rings of Donnie's hell burn you in your slumber
Sleepwalk then pulled under now
Whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden
Slipping through the silhouetted skylines Aesop sidewinds jaded
Don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion
The starving institution broke your main frame
I pose the question, are these waiting games worth it or worthless?
While I comb the crowd for clues your nyebony hands be my purpose
Our planet is the pivotal point
In which this network slowly turns to filter kicks
We out-box the berserk bewildered by the wilderness
My clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush
Touch fools that duel with a dominant
The evil-minded tried to triple six me but he missed me
Intervene; emcees appear as red blips on my color radar screen

APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher, man the loose cannons
"Pennin for gold?" Nah pennin for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand let's
Push, let's push up through the
Now, let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives
Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage, ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of it's
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness
Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding
I'll one up you with love letters from despondency
Honestly appleseed...
Yeah!

On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York...

You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And Good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels and of in with tenants
Spangled cross a more tangible premise
?? it needs splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are generous
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissin pollutin
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man
I try to Spin me dizzy spongin
Up to giving dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement grows a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy elements of elogance and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers chokin open doctors they as born fetus
In a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base
Now these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles
Shedded in the hell tale to motivate blind suspended leverage
Now I'm drowning in a pool of why are you here
Sabotage with my beats the burden pertainance of if I die this year
My name is Dryspell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waiting
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized
My name is evidence
My name is delicate approach from symetricating my fellowship
My name's Possessive
My name is cordial
My name is Igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captain's sake

Let us hope that the horrors of evil
No longer loiter on the doorstep of your past

Circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs
I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis
Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a ??
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
Where trappers slack the traps
Unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line
That will make his majesty furious
Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense
If only, yeah but I'm lonely
My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips Personifying mankind's end all aspirations
Hope floats...
No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked
I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
Arachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
If you can squeeze between the bars
Enjoy my space employ my waste
In case the hand dealt by a stolen grace
Do you ever wish the circle wasn't square
So when landsharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners
There's a ghost in the basket of values
Pertinent to, which cayak pilot succeeded in serving him proof
Now I'm surfin it through
So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See bow to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins
Of innocence
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
Violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference
I grimace, took me one hours blink to conclude that sickly innocence
My name is Dryspell
My name is pillar
My name's allegiance
My name is flagrant
My name's a thousand steps from patience
But I'm sick and tired of waitin
My name's Polaris
My name is canvas
My name is lowlife
My name's intention
My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
My name is carnival
My name is posture
My name is polarized
My name is evidence
My name is delicate approach from symetricating my fellowship
My name's Possessive
My name is cordial
My name is Igloo
My name is captivate
My name is contaminate the rich
And clock the profits for the captain's sake
My name is vagabond
My name is angel
My name is century
My name is hunter
My name is sunburst
My name is wildfire
My name is scrutinize
My name is basic
My name is consequence
My name is cigarettes
My name is cynical
My name is tolerance

My name is

Killaz reflect the destiny of the village
So when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
See I'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
Yea but from here on out its hoof the mare the bare footed urchin
Dig it in person
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack grease into ribbons
Your excused from the roundtable admissions committee
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems and crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yea but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound will keep me warm
When the mornings born with frozen ground
Put a rope down pull me from where the buzzards cleared
I mean from the bones you and your little badass mad max musketeers
When the silhoettes of emaciated frames dance on a highwire
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
But is inserted ghost with dealin
Dead to administer links like chief then whats your forte
Devil dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don't take the wise this minute triplicate pace unified
I don't condone the blasphemy naturally its procreation
From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hell stones
Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
Fuck hugging my cool
The edginess readies the mock knock quick draw hence the duel
The company of similars couldn't excite the motor
But hermit crab Ace home alone-uh
One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stuck in the pluck in the haul buzzing the fuzzing televison mixer
Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed
Pick of the litter, litter of the pick
Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom
There's ample room
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio the bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients will be intense circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budget for nothing
Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern
I can't believe I'm still concerned
I can't believe side children turn in their sleep over one-liners
Well I yield to hear your burns
Color me out of my skull draggin a wagon of creature features
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless
Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
Got em out, killing machines turn belly up
Buckled, the troubles I've seen
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs burn cauterize the gashes after
On my left, one finger for each burrough I can touch
On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
Born for one task indeed
To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed
Look I aint too attired of draggin the baggage over the seasaw seeds
When the reapers turns mortals to caspers
See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimmick the null
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand of a many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall the damned it all up
I hung with cats that do the donts
Cats that forage through the moats
Hoping they open with soveriegnty and a cantine deemed with prodigies
I love the wake, the watch, the walk, the work
The well its almost six o'clock
I've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock (watch) 


Thou mayest indeed
Tune onto the forbidden channel
And see it like it is baby

You should be a champion
Never fall on me
Deceit, deceit, deceit

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

Yo
I was thinking about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my whit's end
30 loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier?
To capture the fashion fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Looked like sickle cells with the principles of high rotary
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Give me the bread crust while considering the littering
I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill
Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung arachnid, leashed by the carnal tyrant
I choked when the cage bird sings and stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I say instinctively break through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the deaths of fallen ideologues and loss and quality control
Quality control, stand still string up the banner
From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy
Incorporate the unison of Vikings ship; throw us best of perfection
Of the twice to burn with half the stone throwers, speak your assessment
My communicative, hinderings please the needs
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's left to splinters
Shiving up the mass of natives and it's league marvels
One component's sure to shock a mass burial, breeze
Broken penny bank fragments float up at staggered seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Iron bandit, give them the stars, the head balloons and rubies
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more

Is that how I feel when I sling?
And the regulars were so amazed

I'm the mightiest slinger of them all!
There is a time for war and a time for peace
And a time to run and a time to split

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

I don't run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy astrals
Where 99.9% swivel the broken axels
I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
Lopsided Star bird bow crooked mass makeshift
Patching holes with chewing gum and sticking sail to dirty bases
Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, 'Cause
I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock
And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension
Of blue sky of a happy neighborhood
String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature
Marry had a case of door nails, Francis little brittle dolls of paper
In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile
Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
Now if I, were to, hold the speed
To levigate the game plan, would you wanna still impede
I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest
And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess
But my loyalty supply hints
And I'm thinking that damn town prior's about to fill this here bucket
It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch
And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
Mood swinging upon the barnstorm with perpendicular traffic
Spread, circle 4,000 circuits you burn to cater wings
Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow
I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio
It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?)

It is the molotov cocktail hour
Haven't I brought you blessings without number?

They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them
Yea
I've never had it so good

"Getting dusty in the cellar"
"Getting dusty in the cellar"
"Getting dusty in the cellar"

And the saints come marching in
Serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population
Caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patriots
The parody plastered every red brick in site
Where had to keep his plights from ticking
I'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that
Roach on my ceiling circular fins round a bed of pushpins
Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
J-walkin a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passages
I'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood
Thanks friend, good looking, I'll never see you again
Feeding frenzy, catfish stomach, empty oceans
Spangled in hooks dangle by anglers off the plank of burning books
And if you're, not gonna eat that
Kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses
Merchant, Goliath dipped in slip shy posture conceived evening
So I feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming
Oh I'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat
Heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note
Oh please, I know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction
Dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung
Skylark litigants strung out like cats straight up participants
I am the triant diaries of a low life siphon through that vein
Anti-diligence movement, here the hunger habitat
Working class trash raped where racist hit their high
I spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick
I witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement
And it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open
The notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure
Within a token of a moment, retless arrested but not a twirp
Strip the Bonabo Disclosure, so close yet so much closer
I'll take the hint but still she's never known cold
Call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that

Back to back to back to stacking a brick match
With the fact that I've sipped the dripping sap tap
Casually out the limbs of captivated blends back
Tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages
Take one down, pass it round among us
Lick a tipper drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest
But you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles
Naw the carpet turned charcoals and made skeletons of warlords
Snake charmer, hate farmer, gave you the rations
With an eyedropper a poison passions hoist above the masses
And interrupts homeostasis seeming flow scapes
Like a symmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards
I'm sleepy, one wing more and I promise to pay homage
To those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long
Sink or swim, ravalor ascension
Even birds of our combines float if you let them
They'll be dodging more than quiddles when the bowel breaks
Note the affiction slip clip to your little visions into cloud shapes
Oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face
We build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
Sling blanks sprayed it with apathy magic balance
On the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me
Honor find it with monster mashing in text casually
On the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction
I'm collapsed under the relic rainbow with seven sepriet
Succulent aqua marines hide the in by sweetest elixir
Star heckler and leaders start gawking at yet another
Real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture
Urgent, the serge is like venom and over kill, kill, kill, kill
The over spilled theory's all faucet
For real, how many leaves your clover got? Mine's got eight
Three for normalcy one for luck four more so you'll spot it from space

I saw the rod-eye cross and murder circle above my turret
Slither spiraling banister down a hide
My ruby glass glazed specs staple to trade the market thieves
Where vendors cop the stolen citrus out they pyramids
Merry without a slapstick mavericks plugged directly to 3rd rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Oooh child, raises oddity, son of a circus side show freak
Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak
Infected projection hung thicken the air
Punching is burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
Sweet Christ crucify me with rail road spikes
Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
All fair the most serene communication's pageant
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell Marry with my name stitched on my heritage
Incinerate arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished wind
Buried in leagues a please, thank you, pardon, excuse me
Your welcome, may I? ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not
Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath
Naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it
Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

You ever died a thousand deaths? I have
And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed
And made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma
Jones and behome alone days sink how my poems I
Dig in the dirt I bring up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
Carpet by my spearheading fink-eye beretta
Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine
Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand salami links
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands spanning for gold
Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 

Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold of ugly tenements
Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle cupping the port to accord it
Teeter thorn storm plunges more but conformers the pouring's half the entry
Plated pearly gates a chanted axis with high gentry hinging our binging on
Public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet
Where the ebony should of cracked shit ratio tragic
Lose sight suit oh mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles and a will to die for nothing
And that's glory abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
All aboard that awful train through shames patch where I'd trade my window
Seat for one pane of replacement stain glass, see I bow to the the gods of opacity
I don't mind y'all looking in, it's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin
And I'm about half way to nausea, half way to contentment
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around master dome patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity the time vibe strapped to dignity my
Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
One, two, three, four, and I'm a tug dummy hug the hungry pull the lever push the button
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest target everyone
Beckon eyes idols that have a malleable colony till the fire ant dropped the
Sweet leaf grief your dreams a needle in a needle stack claiming safety pin physics
Baby tin blizzards collide while ole iron sides trust the rivets
I'm sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit when I know they
Know they owe all thanks to the end all Aesop Rock shit watch this
Build me a home; build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night
And smoke stogs till the day meets twilight
Build me a home, build me a home with a green grass hill with running a water
In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers
Build me a home with a basement and an attic
Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in build me a home
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community harking as wrapped
It's overlooking out crops
Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss on
The least common attachment ten seconds of glittering silence
Pilot is flight redefine stagnant
Most emotions host an entire lesson
Congressional less one stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now
Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
Await a straightened arrows a perfect circle has been fastened to the
Blimp side buy in my grin and clusters that's better than colony my own
Fathers son is the holy ghost suck that theology I king for a day of
Peasant for a pleasant life blood on the easel and my eagle eyelids
Spots runaway pirates look I despise squatters with a, ohh, cry me a
River a quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue
I put my hook in the pond I put my worm
In the hook I put my trust in the worm
That he'd bring me something to cook
I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can
On my pole with a note from the worm attached that
Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole! " Simple parables of nature making
Character giddy and riddle me a similar situation mix city quick put
Your honor on the line doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda
Serpents and report on powers of devil treatment church links I'm a
Fence sitter lips torn by both polars and their working
I can only model throttle at the dream catching matching a patchy holist with a
Sovereignty harbored and charged my hate breed in a minute he's picket
Spitting stitches to fix the britches in the gaps one night I broke in
Bridges give us traps and tried to walk to get stogs just like hop
Scotch between polar caps and I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
Making that classic mockery of every step
Oh build me a home, build me a home please with a light in the window and
A red front door and a picket fence and a fire place and a sturdy frame
And we can sit I'll tell you my name build me home... 

(Well or, and this is, New York City)
Where the shiftiest sources leak out the back door
For more and this is New York City
(Oh, I see these hear walk
I, simply a shade of shepherd
Seems we share fate, honestly)
Oh, now wait a minute
I notice there making mockeries of mad men
Tend not to bend in the honesty
My twenty thousand leagues ending grants sardonic, the sea
(The view from this here segue crowds a listeners nothing special simply
Listeners, how we dissolve it's spores and I'll tell you not flying)
And I live beneath the scenic yeah, where the fossils pledged allegiance
Where the centipedes and serpents bigot on territorial disagreements,
The uprooted turned booty and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll
Suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons
(Left the joke to wick, it,
He walks whose out now, we, Aesop walls up)
We tune out the pouts of hiding,
Twilight street merchants, we, deity freely and been here before...

Murder, of holy, in cushion
Partisan, part of the ceiling seems to be leaking, oh, oh, it's the wall
Forbid box been broken, from man of everywhere, that's what I sleep, I love you
It's not easy tying knots, whose paycheck may get rained
Outstanding I shall smudge, invest, it's dull here, since we need I go beyond
Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different,
Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was (It only takes one slacker)
Traveling up, it only takes one slacker

It only takes one slacker, to attack a lack, gritty and complies with time
With regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries
I'm juiced, noosed father, no dissed deduce
By the ambiance of motives and the modus operandi's
I'm supportive, sort of here to modify those monsters
Tried to side wind pleasure captains round my hip line,
My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among
Us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus
After date rape, and it germs, and I burn for less fortunate starlight
Chasers forced to use there last match to ward off the glaciers
Pack a day profess cloud spitter literate pencifist missed the pissed drunk of concert
Dull and system missed the funk I'm in a lull

I'm thinking of a number from one to red, is a beautiful color
To shade paper hat ink, I'm thinking of a beautiful color...
Paper hat

I'm thinking of a number
From one to home, one riduiculous tennament with no wings to spread
I'm home again inside my box of cardboard daze, I'm thinking of home
And I'm home again...

(Funny how, faces show up, waters for me, my mouth and snore)
It could've been me but it wasn't
The crash and burn and burn and crash infected could collect fee indirectly but it doesn't
(These are broken cards given
To dues missed of friendly lips tied life is going blank, slap look,
It's mirrored universe and one god per so many square feet, and
Everything counts, higher life forms are dirty, dirty Aesop, every penny
Saved, is this the city of dreams?)
And I'm down to Earth
(I'm down to earth, road)
My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns
The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages
Toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage
One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked
Worthy well, your with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity
Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow
Man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly
It must have been the dust, the dust, my god, the dust he clutched the
Dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness...
(Toy, bird, in my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend)

So I heard y'all wanna float...

Yo, this fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring
prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
(I'm broke) I know a walking corpse that spit icicle dagger to slit throat
quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (h...o...p...e)
I paint a portrait of myself, bored life inside the tortoise shell
tortured, orbiting Hell's orchard, intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred childflesh sweeping through my corridor
more than one canteen, a liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
How is you is the villain of my Kabuki hologram
as I hobble with hollow hands (please pin the nozzle!)
we see intent to reinvent dream application with homage to ancients
but honor modern replacements circling now basics (fresh!)
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tippin' the petri dish
beached fish on the shores with a feast of wits eats the corpse
divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
Now that's a harp of a different color (yeah, but the song remains identical)
I am not a crook (crook)
I cook the wick at both ends just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope leaf
(life) sight beyond, I reign where hunger pain got begone
elong to something civil saint 'cause this Rembrandt paints on
and it's a tall canvas, lodged in the gut of Atlantis
I'm pretend, oppressive lungs, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective soul
as the result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp evoked
face it (die), place it on the shelf next to that portrait Mommy gave you
on the day it rained, but y'all posed by the slave ship anyway (how sweet)
make it rain 'till the levy breaks
my defeatist priest is a combine of Father Time and his sweetest concubine (whine)
and it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly five minutes
(you don't want to miss it!)
I've been soaking up my discontent regarding the equation
and I'm officially closed for consultation

I float
when everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
when everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
when everyone around me's busy drowning, I float

I fell asleep again; I wasn't ready for it.
The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season.
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting, and the crops we'd have harnessed mid-november had only brushed the blossom bracket,
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit.
I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses with a plan to tunnel past after the rains had run their courses, but alas,
The portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous, and I'm asking you:
Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers when they know atop the food chain I could spot biters for acres? now be gracious,
These minstrels turned the bully cycle civil by dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels.
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors and their studies connecting one-hit wonders with dust collectors puts it down.
It's down beneath the sappy sing-alongs, let's take it further down, we'll let dante decide which ring I'm on. nova.
The elders took positions and the fans marched, parched, plain and steamed hawking the rain in my canteen. now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads.
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread. well, equation of intrigue, yes yes. let me fence-sit for a bit.
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens. shut the fuck up.
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt, skull fucked crossbones, hence my birth. it hurts.
Check, check, check. must not sleep. must warn others. trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers.
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want. sometimes I take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut and I'm like must not sleep.
Must warn others. trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers.
I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine but it's ridiculous at times. that's why I'm touring with this warning.
Feel it, it's like crowning the glory of our advance (advance). fire ants to water beetles.
Freemasons adjacent to pacing on pins and needles. pupil turned pedagogue,
Benediction to my dream, beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine.
Check it, I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time, gripping the stem in right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline.
It's a metaphor for nighttime. ante up the slight cost of exhaustion to salute the moon above paradise lost, and you're a spectator, scrinching.
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul.
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit, lick my knuckles clean, noting the corporate clusters holding hands around the abode of the damned.
Now what's your poison? starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser.
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later. the eyelids pivot back upon the hinges twenty miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passersby.
Now I'm six foot four with a six-floor walk up just to recline with no free time. the alarm storms at nine.
My daytime's on some "yes, sir. okay, sir. right away, sir. sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir? oh you do? well excuse me, sir, fuck you."
I breathe slow. I run in with these fantastic amalgams painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with plastic albums.
Security's the javelin, catch it. labor. clocked in at '76, and haven't clocked out ever since.
Must not sleep. must warn others. trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers.
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want. sometimes I take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut and it's like must not sleep.
Must warn others. trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers. I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine but it's ridiculous at times.
That's why I'm touring with this warning. feel it, it's like must not sleep. must warn others. trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers.

Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually since the last time)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedigods last flesh
Poison functions accompanied by six armorclad
Black horse and buggy mechanism
Tucked the portion of my severed vision
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
Wit a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie etcetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
Now when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence to blistering
This textbook magnificently prude
Prototype king beserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal
Treasure (treasure), loose cannons span the starboard bow of
The clippership dipped in truth famine pressure
Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon trooper swallow Buddha futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready aim fire, when ya'll rock ready fire aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge marksman, or poacher, it's all the same
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain

I wanna be a big bang, gotta be
Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see or hear a 'Yes sir, sir'
YES SIR!
Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn
Big bang, shoveling a big dig
Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams, I think big things
I'm a burn with this little light of mine
And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'm a be a big bang

I'm just a survivor of the wooly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf
Alien of shallow alchemy
If you gon' metamorph the basemetal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the pesants
I'm floating the homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an SOS infested bottle nested in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow

I observed him fly ten feet then drop the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turn fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I GUESS I LEARNED MY LESSON!
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminant planet
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacket and ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly
From a BC generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
'No blood given, no recognition'
Life matter, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams have gathered
But uh, that certain lack of avail
I sail a choppy lot with bouancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)


Big bang, bi-big bang
It's gettin bigger by the second
Check it

Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the others farewell
I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similars repel
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals
I'm broken arrow to the f**kin bone (broken poem)
I don't really believe in God
But God, I'm scared to death of God
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans
Nor tear the Pod
It's like I hike an acre unimpressed
And slept on the sabre's edge
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge
I wanna know myself
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls

I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug of frigid, got a mug of solar, sliiidde over
The recipe's design unplug the appetite for continuity
By stitching together an esteemed congruence (beautifully)
I peel back hearts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers
Cauterized the wounded heads like 'Gimme gimme something major'
Road side prophetic, ascend well
Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
Blistering in a wishing well
BIG BANG!

The ritual goes, same window different visual.

Wing of wax, or wing of gold leaf
Choose one.
Float or plummet 20 thousand cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
So that I wonder
How y'all chasin' dreams when most tangibles still outruns ya
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I born at
Cut and paste alertness to current set is provided quick
Shimmy the pirate ship mast, spot the islands on the sovereign in her bow
Facing, let's salute the embrace pertinent generals who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles.
Flirtin' with a serpent workin' overtime
Drain the battery, siphon the poison and flood his majesty's hatchery.
I was riding on the yellow bus to where the brush thickens.
Yeah, an it ain't exactly plush pickin's
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge I've ever crossed beneath the sun
Than live my life knowin' you may one day follow me over one.
Snake bite
Breath too heavy to hold.
Caught up in the wake of the red witch tryin' to swim it.
Ran for the sake of dead click stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Thrill, shrunken with a bucket of pennies
I'ma drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies
'Til the cloud burst
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap

In a city of garbage, tryin' to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
Either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.

No enigma, an attempt to bury the hatchet
Rendered me victim of deviltry plus wounded like stigmatics
Somethin's somethin hazardous
I smell an inch of difference in this mornin's pollution pistons and how the loose ends drift in
My sour patch institutions slipped in amidst the invaders and,
Pardon my tone but,
This garden's grown fuckin' acres since my visit.
Itchin' to count the layers in the blizzard to that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and
twists it.
It's the carnival, have you any sweets for my weary kin
It's the carnival, have you any feed for my cheery grin
It's the carnival, welcome, play our games you'll never win
Coz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend.
An' I'm a,
Ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas
Antifreeze to glacier cookin' a look of fiery nature
It's the,
Ceilin' feelin' too heavy to bless the I-beams for a fraction more collapse (I left sorry) that to your door.
Bitchin' my back to hell's kitchen, back
Burnin' murder machinery, released regardless of the pardons
Hitchin my life to the leash of one minstrel
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Play, cooperative supercolony clash (I heard we have a dust collection - let me see it)
Ooh, I duel this underdog verse forced adaption to the marbles of the now
Since then my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground.

In a city of garbage, tryin' to reap the harvest
Adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
Swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
Either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.

The ritual goes, same window different visual.
The ritual is same fuckin' window different visual.

Burn it down...
Pad the circles 'round your life
To capture all the sides you sight
Magic tricks where skeptics sink
The ice is thin, stay off the lake
Waiting for a clock to punch
Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch
If I stop to count the leaves on one of these here trees
Not sure that I know what's pure
Born to kill the insecure
Some respect, some resent, some remain from start to end
Wear my heart on my short sleeves
I'm stuck out here, I lost my keys
From the roof I watch the street
And pray for those that's caught beneath

As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs

I dunno what I have to left
To give other than truth and breath
Angel when she shuts her eyes
Like we will leave to my demise
Between my time is short
About to start my last resort
Wake me up when it's time to make babies
Talkin planet earthquakes
Tied the laces, touch the ground
Let emotions ruptured now
As long as I know right from wrong, I'll be ok I'll sing my songs

I wanna lift every yellowbrick
I never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness
At least not to your and yours
Maybe just my friends and fellowships
As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development
I swear they'll understand!!!
There's a storm outside my tenament
Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline
I guess that's why my homey Blockhead stays glued to the television
Now I look less intelligent
Cuz I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost
Well it's warm by the filament
Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives
Stories lash like coffee and honest-to-God sentiment
Cocooned in the unified efforts to all get settled in
Away from where the rain pours!
Well count your delegates
Weed out the bums who practice migration under the elegant
Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate
But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness
And fall to rock bottom
Spot em with their carelessness
The urge could burst to turn even those hazardous to militant
You can't even have half of free second
The beat comes gelatin
You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran
Buried in merit badges
I'm stuck in the center and could care less
About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements
I got a defense that I call coolin with my brethren
Sometimes I get wet
But it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree?

If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push
But if you pulling while I'm pushing
Then why did you ask me to push?

Television, all hail grand pixelated god of
Fantasy, murder scape and perspective
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Let a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Ooh, I love all advertisements
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit
Now, twenty first century plagued
Dispersed to wide eyed glamor-addict patients
Telecast patrons
Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine
With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor,
Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator
I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis
My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel

Plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch
Lights out, I ain't ever gonna have to leave my house
Satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant
Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance

Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind
And that's fine, and that's fine...

Make me a star, I wanna touch gold
Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my lit up future to the monitor
Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
I can turn from toxicated visuals
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
Fuck the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I want commercials twenty four-seven
I wanna shop from my bed and set an
Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
I bond with a six string correspondence
And lurking circuitry circus
With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Channel zero addict, immaculate
It goes- big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you

Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
I wanna see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance

Plug it in, turn it on, silent fix better than nothing
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?

Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon
Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom
It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences

Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
Your majesty, I love you, I despise you
My everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization
Come along with me, my friend for the most glorious sensation

Shooken to Casper. Illustrate beautiful disaster. Flight of the mothership lift to badger the male-factor. Marionette vs. the threat of wire cutter function. Stereotypical grinch bashing your pumpkins. Plug. Try to count up your warrior hatchling batch before gestation segment ended and head a platoon of embryonic remnants to the game board. Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops, demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate. One massive attack. Hunted, confronted and gutted. Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches. From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces, I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up. Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn. Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs. As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail. I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails. Family stuck. Voyage of the S.S. Martyr. Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water? Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter. We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink. I think I can. I got grips. Muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships. Walk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous cuz my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans.

Fascination. Fascination. And everything I do I'm fascinated with, That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cuz in the end I got my passions while you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle. Fascination. Fascination. And everything I do I'm fascinated with. That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturance with a smirk, cuz I feel I got direction in my work.

And everything I touch magnificent. Picking apart a drunken township. Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with. If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today the day the earth stood still while I complete my search. You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems as boy in the bubble huddled up to simple simon subtle. Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy. Debate the cutesy, groupie, cupie doll community. And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast with a delectable style compiled of that which stands to buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living. I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory. First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood? Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers who truly felt they were born to touch the music. I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my snearkers extra hard. I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper and leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy. Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow. Brother, I own twice my wiehgt in patience. Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb, I'll be listening 'til you whistling that more suitable tune.

I'm twice born, once and seven something
Once is the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling a coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in a posture
The metenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a soubrette columnist fathering doom document
Cursed version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant

I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure it's blurry may have had them speeennnd breeezzzzze
Stuck until my friend leaves puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum numb enough to stomach the city
Who's that hugging a silhouette of willows with a hill's crest pan out?
On the candy coated crab apples, sugar dipped deadpan outs
I got a plan, I'll turnaquet my quest
Defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
With patience galas with absentee balance I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function
With a, ppppppppp paling in comparison a methias Goliath
Live to riggedy frame in a wicked silence
I top and ate my nameless square then I bumped eyelids
With a Christ we saw the same thing through a second
What's that? The grand mosaic depicting historical glory in a legend
Nurse me through the time stick and stone mixes hex my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second the discontent's locked accordingly
Let's turn mummy's shut up affection a berserk glory condition
And pray for the day a star child tugs the ribbon
Meddle in a two-hand grip when that spoon full of sugar medical chaser
Credible crasser antidote's terrible taste the
Water with a stolen soul pen left picture mad rhythm pinned
Never set a grin and fly health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid plan of fabrics
I deemed practical, now is you is or is you ain't compatible
I feel a wind in my opinions plus hyper clutch
Crush one's ginger bread tenement awful,
It's like the day the great oak met the saw mill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion leaves the reaper
At the hand of what man's hand jokes
My friend's got a book about dreams, I look and laugh
I dream a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
Ch-chatter boooox, now let a soothe sayer major
Cater to a king green battered on the brink of disease
I am, skin and bones, I am, sin and poems, I am, tin and chrome
You grin and groans fuck it I'm tinted when accrete zone
Blow the pedals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I'd actually accomplish something
Fortify the bullies of the jokes soaking in treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
On a ghost up in a fuse a lot second before the cock dropped
In the Styx and stared him down until he fixed it

Fashion, it's cool and all but what about God?
(Oh God, well he's the man, but what about reading?)
What, like novels, man that don't hold my attention, what about television?
(Television hurts my brain, how about walking in the rain?)
I hate walking, it's boring, how about some old fashioned gone fishin'
(Yeah, fishing's great but I can't stand hooking the bait, lets dance)
I've got too left feet plus motion sickness, how about breakfast?
(Man, I'm hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money)
Let's fly a kite (Let's burn the generals)
Let's sell lemonade (Let's drink)
Let's poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back and watch it sink
(Naw, lets scare a pupil once a year just to shake the academy)
Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment strategy

I'll make the waterfall out of order in autumn saw the quarter
When the gods mimic the vintage knuckle drag sacked in a coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Clattering the yesterday ain't shed a tear since
Hear me, wrote the Old Yeller community cartoon
The carousel balloon extravagant aware, inviting it
I'm swore to Adam and matter and saddling
Warhead thorax and abdomen to primitive horse back galloping
My index fingers rest in my talisman branded up in the jackals skin
One must pardon yee old common street detour
Weaving graceful through the prom directed column
Greater virus retreats to a lot in Valom
Bean stalk where the fiend walk and my name is mud
But that's got a ring to it so my soil welcomes the flood
I walk through God's practical joke on man practically broke
And if they raise my rent again I'll spend my nights practically soaked
Who spits silk dimensions with a noose looped by the raft?
After lack of reasoning jedi 3, 2, 1,
Oooh I'm hung, I've clung to hope but see you in hell
I'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
Sturdy eye krulin, tin can skeleton,
Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence
I steer where the heaven's merely a legend so the peasants dream well

On the train
Watchin' the rainbows (thank you windows)
I mean, it's all the same to some
But that cityscape makes me numb
Walkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap
Still managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
In my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard
Somethin' for circlin' nutrition (seems barbaric)
I may have just saved your children
There's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle
The pirate tyrant breathes, feed on your precious little pixels
I interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright
I interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole
I'was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked
So I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
We three sprout from the same litter
Yet amazingly crafted by separate scissors
I stalk the morbid beaten past splashin' in the cretin blizzard
Half my time is herded toward little lost causes
Half my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets
An' I'm here to pose inquiries
I'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
Little Billy star lit up the block got the right premise
But can't thread the needle without consultin' apprentice present.
I don't really know you (I don't)
And I don't really care (I don't)
Can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
Maybe that deams me that vagabond you'd love to kill
But I really ain't got time for the motherfuckin' guilt.

I'm gone, and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
Now I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
Set sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous
I'm gone, and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
An' I'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun'l never shine
I've got my book I got my dream I've got myself an' I'll be fine

(My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still
(My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will
(My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill
My time to find a mile before the valley meets the hill
I'm an archer
Partnered with a farmer's board of appetites
Sweetalkin' a rasping down to a mere flashing of badges
Prototypic landscape staged every step of my well-oiled collective workhorse with prose and attention festive.
Wait.
What about the captivator?
I am the product of skeleton dancers voice crooked scattered amidst blue fields of firey bliss tricks
Where disease applicant activist rattlers, fascinate brave child
Where expectant slave smiles at the stick in the painted living
God, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would
I'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
You see my mission's responsibilities range across the board
And so I'd rather be a pen than a sword
I swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready
All edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy
(Sorry, well sorry) Honestly take it or leave it
Just let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness throughout the evening.
Basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
Tryin'a pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost
Brasher than more ways in ten years sturdy bird construction
Help the smokestacks puff until the morn, dream torn

I'm gone, and I best believe I'm leavin'
Packed up my belongings then it's off into the evening
I've knocked upon every little door that comes about
I'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch.
I'm gone, and I best believe I'm leavin'
Pack up my belongings then it's off into the evening
This turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can,
I think I will.

I was sitting on my fire escape and I saw...
Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons
A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags
I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting (boom)
I saw a blind man with a dog screaming 'someday I'll see it all'
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
Business men with multi-colored ties, cashmere checks
A nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam war vet
A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his names
A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street

And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
I see a teen mother with similak pacifier and regrets
Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
A slide show of six civilians gripping bottles of gideon
Sitting inside bent meridian
There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout
Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
Tyrants, I see sirens
The wall to the glamor standard
A dead bird, a bent curb
A bus stop of commuters waiting to have their souls towed off to work
I seen the slap dash habits of bike messengers paws
And hug that good leaf on the way to damaged packages, dependence
Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more

Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks

My every little step set in a star,
Retina Scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile.
My experience with a spirit alignment interference assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling.
Let's note the magnificence in the difference.
OK see two canaries on the wire aspire to separate luulabies both of which had me drifting.
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss and list picking from the arrangment under burden. Bust.
Wallow in will to split the privelage cluster; Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path- dispatch trouble.
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life. Social conduct, 20 pace, about face, self destruct.
I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause, well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times.
Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess; one man's trash, you know the rest, live it.
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard. When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot.
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers, wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer.
Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend- I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin.

(it's like that)

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit;
I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit;
I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall, to live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall.
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall, and I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall.
And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all.

(Electric charge comin' from the mainframe)

(Electric charge comin' from the mainframe)
(I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks)

(Electric charge comin' from the mainframe)
(I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks)

Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the path.
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward toward the traps.
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent the most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets.
Water basin leaking, plug it up.
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection.
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony to nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me.
And so the epic went.
And every cirrus hung.
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung.
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in. i'm frantic.
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump. Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump.
Be wary when the stratosphere tints.
I Scout like Atticus Finch, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance.
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every holocaust citadel fix it plan.
12 easy steps to better picket line demeanor.
Gumshoe.
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive.
But the sky is falling. F-f-f-fuck you.
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week.
Cheek to the heartache.
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substancial for me to lamp in.

(Electric charge comin' from the mainframe)
(I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks)

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit
I was born where all the kings man couldn't mend a broken spirit
I was born where no matter if you stand sit or fall to live or die as a brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall, and I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall.

And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all.

(Electrocharge commin' from the mainframe)
(I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks)

Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams

Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!

Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo challenge an Ox member, get a vow severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like 'Look mom, no hands!'
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like canines
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like baretts
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I dunno if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethen
You play the role/roll, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection

If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the pesants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

I boogie with picketer vision
carbon based stickler
City piss aroma therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if the sunbeams flatline via thick fatigue episodes brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed at perkes nurse broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center housing style pagents
My little limbs lasso katydid wings while mankinds babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of mass times weight times tamed semantics encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic
We edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, aprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again, It still never ended suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts, start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear, let the tears braid and skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold plated tomb or spitoon, I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance

So you want to be a carpenter, do you?
Well it takes more than a hammer, boy, you're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and...
Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war.
Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?
Sluggish posture just won't cut it.
You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes!
And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help,
And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone
And, where's my pencil? go get your hard-hat,
here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper...

Yo
I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs,
I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun.
The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit,
Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it.
My stitchin division to vision warfares numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath
and skip stones in the morning as I,
Lie in color phantom tantrum explicable, sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches,
Magic happens!
Behold, pity the lowlife parish.
Doom City barracks left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris
To the Badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands,
Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman.
Frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay where the landshark Parliament swims
When they pause to polish they fins.
The better brains will preach the village through the city square
to the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate,
Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase.
Ooh my bomb's light simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly
Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die.
Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp,
Had that phase when the devil tree contacts a sparkle in my eye.
Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink,
Salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks.
My house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled,
Cuz I stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry,
Come visit me,
It's fascinating.

Now here's how its done, I'm only gonna show you once,
So pay close attention, hear me now or hear me never,
Glue your little eyes to the diagram,
See the plywood, the nails, the glue? You work every inch,
Your domain and you must treat it well.
Keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole.
Where's the T-square, hand me the pliers,
now dammit, oh this will never do!
You have to want the castle, Head Up, shoulders back!
Be the materials, know your limits only to break your limits.
Are you listening? God dammit boy, pay attention!
Try it again. Little bit more juice this time.
Try it again. Yeah a little bit more elbow grease this time.
Try it again. Concentrate, a little more focus this time.
You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help.
Try it again. You're not doing it right, here now, yall watch.
Try it again. Stop sulking, I'm the example, for real, Watch.
Try it again. I'm bout to make it easy for you yall, just Watch.
You can kick and scream and yell but damn I'm only tryin' to help.

stinging the hunt
The hunt dispatched a pack of wild dog silhouettes,
All sulking by the skyline, focused with a bonus hunger pain,
My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the mug of
Ancestral branch camped on the vessels.
Yes and I abide, the laws of the hidden desert survived,
And every peasant presenteed it on the crescent less deprived.
With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests
of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess.
I double the negative, to no avail, no promised benefits,
just delegates peddling pairs of negatives,
With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut.
Now what of the madness fragments? Stagnant.
I oughta make a vision sing my twix cling to your pigeon wings,
Vision militia indent benders, we've flooded Hell's kitchen sink,
Walkin' eye civility simpleton citizen mixers to kiss the sky in unison
Sinister city-blistered corporate rule-igans.
All I really want's a nickel to feed my little pigs.
Big Dick three cheers to the product.
Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process
When a slanted advantage point sort of makeshift criminals date rape the hostage,
Dream away the blame pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks,
And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks.
All I ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle I got,
See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop.

Try it again. I don't want to.
Try it one more time.
I'm not even interested anymore.

Sulking and bulking a half
Sulking a laugh crash test
Figure the mixtures digging up his last breath
Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftan
The tapwaters on the waters off the waters leaking

So this is blue

I'm tryin to walk alone and miss the bliss inide the accidental meeting of the pencil

January, I fell to the cobblestone
In April, I cut little paper flowers
In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome
In October, I was introduced as coward
I love New York Saturdays
But Mondays last longer
And since I plan to live a long life
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn
To merge the week for all its got
To give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs)
I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage
I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel
Then I settle in a stand still
I live forever reaching for the sun
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful
Rope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil
And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
I never felt so damn young
But you don't look a day over zero
And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize
The night is near so
Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges
I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges
I never really knew the true definition of precious
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message
I'm a fully animated life tree
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
Of I'm a fully animated life tree
With branches for the heavens to admire naturally

Fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine
Cringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate
Destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem
Health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time

We all know what a halo is
But we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips
I be the matador making your pretty little heels click
I be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse
I'm incredibly exhausted
You can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete
Freedom freedom freedom fighter beginning
For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic
Every little step she takes breaks the chambers
In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble
Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour
Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk
I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles
Fiddling with a theme, dream solid
Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish
You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise
Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision
Which in turn allows me to be something normal
With the prefix of the 'ab'
I can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that
Rockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it
Be the little guinea pig, dig?
I'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water
No splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch
It's like that

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing at random
Princess, raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle)

And it goes a little something like this...

Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cut-throats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal, wander prominent... honor (honor)
I barter silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep a spare wing strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

So you mean these things are worth money now
Drifting off this is the who you calling homeless
Mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row
Tickets to the dead concert and your in it
Icabod running out of morals for my allegory... moseying
And my kind of people will sell only circles...
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but pretty bird just ain't muting the many

Oh it'll be soon, Balloon immune to doom blend
I ain't ditchin' the kitchen til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow's sorry looking lot of hopefuls
Was the rain dance my little flint never dreamed would flutter potable
I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place. Incoming .
You wanna be a czar?
Idolize fallen heroics, recognize root of the worship
Search and hold it.
Who put the fun in dysfunctional?
I, prodigal son combustible
Donkey punchin' pinholes in uncomfortable
Zen conjuctionals for good.
The bear cubs slob a goblet of dirt wine
I nurse a single application of introvert serpentine

A sunset without a scrape of red plastic bag
Noise sunk down around his head sick, sick, sick... stealing a peak
There's a sickness in the roofer's eyes
And his alone and nothing terrible happened to the bag
Wrongs spilled off in and brought on out the clouds
The hiss cut's out spills it's voice into me and the window
Full of star is fresh kept from where I'm going
Or the other only other way art.

I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

And before, when I said
"Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business"
That was to be in vein
Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished... uhh
Well you see I usually finish this number with my skull open

Everybody rally round the novel burner, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Now the masses wanna lean on me like 'Oh Captain, my Captain'
Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments...

"Button, button, who's got the button"
Take my name... please...
Leaks the little gentle-man
Made out of lightning inside my lock box
Oh, you like to help with coats
Wait until you see what I got in this here locket

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing at random
Princess, raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle)

No more pencils no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now let's build

Every tenderfoot cadet better they be slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a plastic catalogue
And where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set em' free and let em' feed
The devil tree penciled me in but I slept thick through my alarm sock
Slick Willy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating man to the high ride, base tied
Face mine's and make God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Cut into 5-digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destinies resting with red worms chewin" off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the f-5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker

If I botched the operation I apologize (sorry)
The air's rooted in carbon
I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
I'm fresh out of Geppeddo's woodwork asylum
Cedar frame, wire-bound knuckles
Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle
Well when a page becomes a squire, re-engage, clap your wings
When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (glory hunter)
Is it genuine enough to feel baby felon
Negotiate comradery of wills
Hows this my little loom
Perv surgeon with dirty dominion monitor boxes
Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins
Now y'all ain't excused from table side
Till the dinner plates fly
Slurping' liquid happy citzen enhancer
I got this slicky sycamore head shaker
Mimic stitch and splinter entry
Thereby filtering citizens hit-man prior to acts descending (tight)
Cats know the ambiance calm beyond comparison
Captive, passive spring loaded serenity
I'm trying to give this city acupuncture
Shovin one-way pins in subway systems
Stand up where I'm layin, now that a runway vic (push)
Made you go batty, spreading spawn legitimate
Spice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic


I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems
So one overlooked the scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
Then rock like medusa glances
You ran the final mile before the blanks blow
Home alone sippin beetle juice
Just to numb and then shimmy the needles loose
I built a castle out of fifty-two cards
Plus jokers with an image
Modern theory jars us while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm mad at how far this is dishonoring Occam's Razor
But it seemed so being fatigued knuckle work (labor)
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located the matrix then impedes

"This is labor"
Who put the monkey wrench in well oiled prefectionist emblem
Just to watch these moniters spit white noise
through your office space auto made
I infect knowledge gene pool dissented cloud clusters
Brushing dust mites off your starborn all revolution sound jugglers
Delinquent fan for brick habitat bob, weave, stick, move fence
and put somewhere in the middle for slick invention
This years brain crop spread spectacular
I ain't mad at cha don't stay mad at the caliber
I twist characters like twist characters
Talley up the alley cat aggresion
in this Doug E. Fresh infested mess up bassline lust
An automatic B-boy krylon can't combust circuits
Working these war picked cyphers
with head striker stability and kamakazi chivalry
I alone noble in a warm food feud
Walking ten generations ain't nobody asking for your patience
Who ranned off but only meet to face the fact
that I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else
(Talk about labor) Fantastic planet urchin puting work in
Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversions
Apologies won't lore me to the communal sob story
nor would I sacrifice lifestyle to benefit jewerly temperament
This whole Green Goblin webcutter butts up against
crayola daydream landscapes spittin bedlam, Datum
Charge the villagers nickles and nicotine
to watch them fed to undiscreniled crack at the high noon
(We sell popcorn, beer and balloons!)
I got an echelon this gon be the one children bicker over
And start warriors vs. baseball fury element
to glitches mode of century development
I am a star really! The big bang bastard's back
with a one way ticket to Beat Street
This soil is like relevent to human concept
plot the man ratios man learning, I work past the service
I work on what I love, I work the service on my vertince
And I work till this here little flat line closes the curtains


Yo...put one up shackle me, not clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo and a stick poking your patience
Ya'll catch a 30 second flash visual
Dirty cooperative Neptune blue head hurt splits
Ridiculous fathom the splicing of first generation
fuck up or trickle down anti hero smack (Cracking!)
I paste the game to zero all completion green (Splash!)
Took an early retirement pick a dream
American nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
and you would stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's an honor and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Marry crutch stolen wretched refuge refuse my teaming resonance
I promise temperance storm breed with a leaning conscious
In a credence relax responsive with my sports outsource the wattage
And I'm sleeping now (Wow!) And the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buses drag your brother's flags into rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs
You won't be laughing
And I hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot them then I forgot them
This origami dream is beautiful
but man those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.

Slacker bounded imitated tabloid headlined with the post
Shimmy cross the centerfold, and a dead time in ghosts
Giving crumbs for the better souls with seven deadly sins
To hear the plane to crystal conscious
To results a low life counting on one hand what he's accomplished
Ok, lift me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug in deteriorating zenith pen dragging
I hack swords wars for the morbid spreading of mad men
Now he's got soul
Sitting there licking log cabin in Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig zag and zig 'em again for the bad dreams
Sparking my brick wall windows another thicket storm
And if one night in Gotham without the wretched
Houston we have a problem
Dispatch a task of infested patch of city goblins
Who split how many freaks with box cuts of a high road bellow
Heads ripped! Watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Raw feelings start congregating at pamper for bickering
Life's not a bitch life is a beautiful woman
Your only call her a bitch because she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire or either pass it for some pagan thresh hold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black of porn visuals hear the duck hunt ticker tape
Vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
When I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain!
This cat is asking if I've seen his little lost passion
I told him: "Yeah, but only when I pedaled past him"

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way.
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day,

Pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb
Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mixer
Kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler
It's bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
I branch out, arms flailing backwards
Wailin upon a tidy sound circuit
Slightly foul Gershwin
With a bed of nails and drumlust plus disgusted service
Workin in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace
I be the now observatory eye ear antenna feeler
Spittin like a dragon with a similar demeanor
Stood innocent bystand witness the diehard fans turn Rip Van
In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet
Now I'm thinkin who am I Jabberwocky Superfly bent left
Pushin war without the ten step cushion and what (what)
I plan to hold this beat positive sacred in these golde veins
Until the day I die from grimace overload
It's shock (it's shock)
Treatment offered by the weekend
This still be a getaway, let's display the sequence it goes:
One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless
And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (under the carpet)
I drag a yellow taxi meter behind every measure
And charge cats for labeling me shepherd
"That'll be Six Fifty plus tip darlin,
I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons"
Huh, got caught up in the universe tryin to zoom in on stardom
Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon
Next time you wanna be a hero try saving somethin other than hip-hop
And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop
Kill em all, yield
(naw man It wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield brother
I just read and pulled the trigger)
Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates
Capture the halo, jet back to base, step past the chase
The bad taste of jet-lag and weight slackers
There ain't nothin broken, where you at?
The pistons pump perfect, where you at?
The bass tone is Merlin, where you at?
This service is a urgent workin surgeons
Purging formulas lookin for an improper cause is whack

What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, no honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (damn)
Promise me you gon shut the fuck up and recognize
What you holdin ain't really broken?

I don't flick neeedles like my sick friend (friend)
I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend (trend)
I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend (end)
And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen.
All I ever really wanted was a getaway
I'm a take a chance by letting a brook slide for what I got in my hands
I can not agree to follow a leader while on the borderline
A war without a reason for the Brady hates gore
Bring out your dead we can put em in a pile
And burn em with the novels for the kids then to admire
KIll the ones that speak from a different life
Brewin other killer noise makin the sentiment...

Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit
Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
Oh yeah I'll let God warm the bench for now but
I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
(and for the record I'm bringin my t.v. with me)
Yo, let the commoners speak publicly
Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil
But can't see past the loophole
Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets
With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise
(let em grow leisurely)
Hey Mom, I'm a fix without my probe along this path
Once my shpeel's perfected I'm a save you a seat in the front row
Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
And when all these bickering crowds turn solid you gon be proud
I tack hacks to the (backboard)
Honesty's a (latchcord)
Fury's far from (obsolete)
Serenity's a (crack war)
Raw caricature of mayhem standard branded by the labor
With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
Saw the brightest burst ironically wide from the vacant stage
Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider pickin up your record

What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, no honestly)
What are you saving, honestly? (damn)
Promise me you gon shut the fuck up and recognize
What you holdin ain't really broken?

The Authors, they ain't got nothin to save
The Overground, man they ain't got nothin to save
Def Jux, they ain't got nothin to save
The Addams Family, they ain't got nothin to save
Weightless, they ain't got nothin to save
Stronghold man, they ain't got nothin to save
Rhymesayers baby, they ain't got nothin to save
Aesop Rock, I ain't got nothin to save
It's like that...

"We'll have more news after this commercial word"

(As so it goes..)

"At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?"

In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

"I don't know what got into me
I didn't even cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry"

This be the big
F-L-A-S-H-F-L-O-O-D, Flashflood

"Possible" "Conceivable"

"That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berzerk?"

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was joshua, age 10
Bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree, and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo
parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passers-by
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attachin lines to concrete
But she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed
And believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk,
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today??"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away

1 2 3
That's the speed of the seed
A B C
That's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream
Or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it
Cuz dreamers always chase
But never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors,
Actin nice, although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch??"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
Cuz while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed, 'bout 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
"Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
Well!
The nurse jumped back,
She'd never heard Lucy even talk,
'Specially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died.

I start my city with a brick (one brick)
Then add another brick (two bricks)
Brick by brick, I manufacture homes for fallen angels
I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
Respect the polars but acknowlege middle-value rainbows
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Slingin bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
Yeah rocks the match that burned the Nazi journals
And plottin verticals amidst blatantlly horizontal
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
And I'm tired
Tied up on these functions
Killer cottoncandy clouds and huckleberry justice league
Another knuckle-dragger dungeon breed
Run, breathe, sit, bellow
Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo
Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
When Little Billy bought a Tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Facist takes for the pegleg's birds and eyepatches
Learn that lesson, you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk
And got your crayons wet, the room reaks of a thousand bayonettes
I'll fision vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
Connecting life with that little species of midians
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock an Apple to the core but ya'll ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Ya'll prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
Play "Taps" out of order
For a ballad, corpse a dead man walkin
You can lead a man to a city but that don't assure civility
You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg cd's
(That's more fun anyway)
Some cats Float, some cats don't
I speak in Farenheit and burn off colon lyric
Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
Don't dismiss the billygoat appearance for that common sheep

Platforms have been erected
Effigies built
Slogans coined, songs have been written
Rumors have been circulated
Autographs faked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Mantlepieces dusted
Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
Curtains have been closed
Sleepers all waked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape

Now with my trusty paperclip
I picked locks of thoughts vault
Finding the God in barren
The harvest fruitless
Only the Tree of Life flourishing
Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless
Is that, predestination or is it by design?
That I'm trapped in time sand
Show radio mission control but for my rhymes
Man cuz I can like aluminum
And I recycle my consciousness
This is just a note
For any action or lack thereof as a consequence

Wingless angels
Stroll a top shapeless cottonballs
With halos in your syringe
Celestial ground is found broken
Exposing a bottomless depth
Where heartless spines awake to devour
The small piece of your soul that's left
You're immersed in sound floating
Aimless destination
Drop anchor to gain stability
Stare out potions, restrain fertility
Pedestal talk is a token
Soaked in pockets with lives, topics, lack conceptual, ridicule
The night breathes but light's choking
Darkness occupies the throne
Where poems are persecuted
The purity at times dilluted
Rhymes are executed
For genre I'm told when has-beens attempt
To cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold
Life's an oragmi box and I'm hidden within the fold
So when the yarn unravels, I won't be caught by surprise
And as society's fabric of orthodoxes dismantle
I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise
See when the canvas stands before me
I'm compelled to spill a vision
For the sinners that listen, I got three spikes and a thorned crowns
It seems I need a new soul cuz mine is worn down
But from the pregance of my hardship was born style
Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought
Finding me lost among statues and mainstream idols
Browning in melted ice to reinforce that breath is vital
If your father and his father were fish out of water
You must break the cycle
How many times must a plant be uprooted for it to die?
When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky
So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs
With a million watts
And throws the switch, sparks filament
Hurting new giants and flocks
I stand my own two aura illuminated in red
Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit
Sacrificing itself for the health of a masocistic culture
Yearning for the truth that we speak but refuse to hear it

I could make 'em all dance, or I could sleep
I could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
people are made of match sticks, light this bread a flames
note at the craft work door the last smirk of the the Damien mainframe
my box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets
inhabit ocean bottoms with a bitter rotten scapegoat pardons (note to self)
don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
where participants squeeze your last giggle then whittle sacrificial finalies
I can tie my new faces alone, save your knee deep offerings
sorta bring puke coughing bunk persona to light (I might)
build railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
what should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer"

(dear sir or madam, your son or daughter's embarrassed human kind
consuming booze and gut fuel, till they cruised across the line)

I spin gold, your raps are dirty lapsed
towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble
(yeah I could of been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle)
man huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep
towards the right idea
this basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic, fold origami
plantation shut this picket fence
hang on to your dreams kitten, you'll probably never hear this song
let alone sip the mission long enough to listen

(I smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space
now I'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
do you really think your maker wouldn't notice?)

Okay, I've died a thousand, and I'll die a thousand more,
I leave footprints in fours, two for bi, two operate
practically caress the utterings of crushed brothers and sisters
mothering stickler cabin and madden shit
I'll fix the wing for a penny and a parabole, yeah but this friendship
sunk with a barrel full of pull
I seen guys harbor bad shiners
then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending
want's garbage bag liners
with out the apple seed it's useless (I sat for greed)
patched for boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks (I sat to breath)
I breath to hard nearly metamorph castle loose pins
now I stand to breath as not to disturb the
and I know that's not a story, it no longer turns my stomach
hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit
but a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it
win a ticket to right white lines highway sideways
one love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
laughter bats that hung from my rafters
see the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
that clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck)
now I ain't gonna name name's, and I ain't gonna drag others in
but I ain't about to say that I'm the only cat you got bubbling
your lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people
who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure

(knock the fuck off, kicking his lip across the floor
'til the archival vinyl venom soak the
anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners
fusing a million majesty murders then stole the crown)

oh wait that's right, you discovered me right?
offered up the peace pipe, and oh
It's all cotton candy when Aesop Rock the B light
he's actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
(oh we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks)
oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle
built foundation out of passion and brother dusty
studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems and syllable placement
your just mad cuz somewhere in there you came and went (I ain't the type to dwell)
dismissed it as casually non compatible and bounced
obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like
(damn that sounds fresh) or (damn that shit is garbage, what happened? I'm not even laughing)
yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked)
you made comments to the wrong who out of respect and honor leaked your program
now like were both trying to sit and breath another dawn so my advice
to you is when I say just "move on"

"We now present to you...music"
"Music to make you stutter"

I've been a biplane dog fighter Henson invention
Trooper burst result of Dragon Ball Z/Speed Racer gene splicing
Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty
Destiny dream sighting, important as split the prints
God shit the planet screaming "What on Earth is that?"
I sit back five dimensions
Only to muscle the overcooked specimen
Fending tragic fatality successful dodging violets
All hail Mary and hello dollies!
I flow ridiculous, indigenous to now
Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Terradactle circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We icegrill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking b-boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
With wipes clean the billy goat beard, camoflague the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah never swam up inside summerjam classic
Under the bed backwards bastard
Scaverning the carnival grounds for an outlet
WHO THE FUCK IS AES ROCK?
I'm not a name to keep at arms length
Adjacent to little ? quilt makeshift
Sick security mechanism, check your mission
I am not a vision, check your mission
Just a simple sourpatch delinquent
No it will not help you shove your Lincoln

I alone settle
I alone peddle in the mud
I alone, I condone rebel zone planting
I alone stand in a social coma
All up to your dome, follow I alone

"Now you see me, now you don't"

Well he was maverick enough but still scraped up
Taki 183 innovation for the kids
Brick foot ironlung honor
Escape through the night like a disgruntled teen Krylon bomber
Without a care inside from posting the roster
Mal-adjusted blank faced civilian dispersed feelings
Reeling in several separate defunct fame-booster modules
This nervous twitch mark the most delectable ingredient
See Aesop starving troops in cell blocks with strap-on feeding bins
(More like) Like I'd auction off a fuck for that blind cause you ride in
I'd rather find the floors and watch you hide them
Feel the haggered look penetrate brain castle
Blasting clear out the back of this batches sour wind collection
(FLASH FLOODER!)
You're a fuckin wind-up toy
A goddamn four string criminal trading card
The reason they decorate the fonts of closing credits
To boost on-looker amusement after fading hard
Catch more Z's than Rip Van Winkle's 12 Step Narcolepsy Seminar
The action, we all compete the masked illusion
The commonfolk, I provoke em all
Challenge thirty balance
I alone pour talent while they fidget
If the revolution ain't gon' be televised
Then fuck, I'll probably miss it

Yo change the fuckin channel
I burn a Coma candle
When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample
We them cats talkin noise behind that New York trash heap
Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep
And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers
Training Generation Fallout
Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out
There's smoke in my iris
But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
So I'm ready now (What you ready for?)
I'm ready for life in this city
And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me
I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass
Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles
Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals
Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool
(This is our school)
I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool
Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool
(Man please) Man please
My name stands for my being
And my being stands for the woman who stood
And braved the storm to raise this evening
(Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful)
Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence
Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishers wish
But missers miss, I slept through my appointment
Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify
And picked the rose that wilted
The second I introduced myself as Nervous
Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken
Some are burning, some have rosen
Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them
Some are just a brutal reprocussion of devotion
Mine are all of the above cause everything leads to erosion
Now where I live there's a homeless man
He sits upon a crate
He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make
Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show
Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this

And I ain't getting any younger
My knuckles wear their bruises well
I've yet to lose that hunger
But only time can tell
Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch
And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks
See your name is Ambiguity
My name is something hands can't hold
But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold
It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick
Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now
And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest
But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock
Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds
To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel
Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn
But y'all numb from gut fuel
I administer eclispe, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor
Cause a martyr-made motor don't quit
I am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal
Channel surfing my way to the top
Tugboat in a bottle
With no holes poked in the nozzle
I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight
Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile
And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the medium
The second my halo ran outta helium
Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull
I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry
But my energy's a rental
So I take this now to say
Thank you seniorita for holding a flame to a lost wick
Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego
Y'all are family for life
I'll take that bullet to preserve you
I wanna be something spectacular
On the day the sun runs outta batteries
Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy
Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn
Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this
(I ain't gettin any younger)

Raw, I'm going to give it to you
With no trivia
Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted blissed felicia
While bent funny bone grown community
Spit a thousand m-1 ripples to cripple the continuity
Tap water builds character
Right I irrigate it straight to mainline
You want to do the same? Fine
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify the clot to slippery city salt piston pump drain
But hold those incredible console with the Russian roulette baboon spin-off
Where everyday a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
One-sixth buckle
Five Sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
But I'll get you (I'm going to get you)
Wobbly rope bridge
Broke inches tired of dry land
But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix-down well
Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads: I didn't do it!
Is it on, is it beyond basic
Does it ice grill you or is every song faceless?
Does it have a title? If didn't would you name it?
Does it babble about nothing like a drunken atheist?
We could run that Or' Wells '84 war
For the room 1 on 1 z-tour
Till he try and fidgets with his or her own work spear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision
I'm going to suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your features never fit in
Servers you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
I'm going to tiptoe across this yo-yo string
Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down

It goes boom boom boom
Boombox

Earth to a-r vertical burden has increased at an alarming rate
This is down a point
Murder up, glee down and still falling
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays
Came this blind soldier-burning confessional
Ease back; let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
Let the back burner boiling point descend
I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)
Strike personal space with the most utterly putrid version of grace
Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget
While we try and jump through hoops
Like Coney Island freak show midgets
Want to be a fighter pilot
Driving that childish early Wright brothers experiment
Prototypic model fossil
Sit and sweat bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts
Outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Dead before the chubby decry ton conquered the high note
School by the cruel intention inventions pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty
I alone advance without an earthly poem
And dance on a handful of zoning fans
Holding every chance to own the land I roam
With dome in hands
Truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convinced myself it's on
Therefore it is and the melody settles
Beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get them all open
And once I quit and said I didn't care
That's when they all threw their hands up in the air

It goes boom boom boom
Boombox

Yo
I take 10 steps with a bedlamped vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and shake hands with my grimace that remain up in
my face like top to bottom train car feelings
Lets question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affect
I'm blow this hex over the mission
Just to administer the indoor sucker punch to its pitiful condition

With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
"Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do

It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, act of development first of madness

Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion

A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient
In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing
Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)
The traincar used to be my apartment
Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out
Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout
"The Biz is Coming, The Biz is Coming!"?
Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)
We just getting flurries now?

Yeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn,
You're movin much to fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like 1970 something 20 clicks outside your name (tear obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
but they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
just aint working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
to intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
together specimens from the promise land
This for the thinkers
This for the erchants allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
but cant remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all that's said and done
are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one

Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves has begun (Water one)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland
Icicle-bound barren township
Call barren moon childs and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinkin like a paper tugboat
Well beneath your holiday
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag

It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the riverside park tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify the serbonite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other mothafuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zues fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your homily dream out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen alot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed the city scape up skin to blend in
Rats travel by night invite the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong
When it's prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Had a hatchet slice for camps
For that God-awful Frankenstein
Starving your style to someday be a story in my
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everyting in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these officials bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)

"Yes the bough is low
That's the way it goes though....
Maybe I should just give up or stop trying
But life is so uncertain, so short
I've got to keep on searching
And wherever it takes me, I've got to go"

Ban away temper tantrum, decrept anthem
Set a low go, I arrived late
I'm here to scrape a car clean to the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(You got heart)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers missed one of they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift-Candy Land-cold classic-bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
Doing base throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)
I'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
Walkin like a Jabberwocky
Scalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
Christmas with a shallow stocking
Like this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)
You drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him
Soundin off like senior citizens sitting at bingo parlor bickering
Yeah it's kinda funny, isn't it
How I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus

Dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase
Bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes

Skeptical of the handshakes

Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolesent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self pride at Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the hot that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self pass the word, eyeing stubborness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And someone, I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffiene team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel heartstring Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, ending
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It can roast my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pasttimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Your response, dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spitting forty plus a week
And trying to rape earth on my off time
You bought dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'ma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine to five day-in day-out
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pasttimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless
Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

I don't shrug instead of the ramifications of my shovel
Lovin the consequences of uprooting the jungle
I'm huggin the cyclo Gemini stooped contenders from viewin the puzzle
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas

My kitchen sink leaks like your itching to speak a secret
'bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why?
His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns
And when the children met divinity I sat to watch the merge
It goes pandemonium live
Ya'll mutha fuckers stand up volunteer tantrums while your playin summin vivid
Play your sympathy card till the misery clash
And a basket case is in a classless matrix with elastic stitches
Raggin a bag of lonely poem remnants
Short of breath like you're short of fresh
You're a portable mess
Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics, orphans
Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes
You're a spectacle
Pushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking
You touched the hand of God and I'm like
What are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man
By sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in
You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic
Like the king of the mountain requires a boost
I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at live aid clinics
For the thrill of 9 great mimics with 18 bloody lips, spittin
Beanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly
Walking uphill trying to get down
Prominent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness
When the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker
Service in the greater half of nature
See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely
Warmingly piggy leader colony to comfort
Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured
Till he won't define his Tourniquet Still Functions

I don't shrug instead of the ramifications of my shovel
Lovin the consequences of uprooting the jungle
I'm huggin the cyclo Gemini stooped contenders from viewin the puzzle
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas

Burn burn em mostly
Stuck unplucking plumage out the poultry
Soaking in bulk on a sofa with ductape upholstery
Dirty doc stellar space medic
Stoned by the commoners for glowing
Psuedo bloaters buy them beats till bloated
Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion
Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter
You can sign your life after the facts
Wicked soldiers pickin with buddy system
Logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot
All in a days breath
I guess
Sandman hit up or shatter a day when television run over baboon heart transplants
Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps
With a iceman dance and stand with a
But maybe I do
Yeah yeah maybe it's all over
Maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter
I mean absorbing attention's a must
You don't wanna be overlooked
Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much
One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats
And the angels who never hit a bad note when harmonising
I'm an armour plated farmer
I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow
For the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues
Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench
Either you drink it or sink it, cause there ain't no sitting on the fence
You make me chuckle child, it's hells kitchen now, miss
Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish

I don't shrug instead of the ramifications of my shovel
Lovin the consequences of uprooting the jungle
I'm huggin the cyclo Gemini stooped contenders from viewin the puzzle
I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas

Encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas
Encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas

Night Light suckas..
Put one up shackle me, not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate my old halos and pass em out to the pavement
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative Neptune bloom head-trip split
Fantastic! Fathom the splicing of major league low lifes
With anti hero earthworm mentality (Godzilla!)
I paste my game to zero all completion
See a cretin's still a cretin even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open so you can stagger through
Then ten berserk and bread cookies in after you
It's the gutter and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teaming dumb luck
Still I promise temperance storm breed still bleeding Amish
See the freaks sucked out the bottom dropped 3 bears and a baby in a cottage
And I can't sleep now
Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted by the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow up doll's
got a headache and won't give up the ass
And I lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun them to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces
Spit 'em at your species
Reachin' the city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night-light got me when the daylight went to evening
Night (Light) Day (Light)

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse.. plus
We Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please)
With seven deadly stains
To hear the plane to crystal conscious
The results a dead-beat trying to make a dollar off a bomb threat (OK)
Lift me to activism chain activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws of a morbid glutton
I can spot a drunk battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle
Zig zag and zig 'em again before they can pull a badge out
But I lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham like
"Houston we have a problem"
They're buffing the trains the same days the graffiti writers bomb 'em
Who split how many freaks on box cuts of a high road bellow?
Heads ripped! Watch red bricks turn yellow
I'll try to meet the wizard
But a tailgating tit-man holding an oil can
won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch, life is a beotch
who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
out searching for the G-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole; maybe I'm just an asshole
Kiss the speaker wire, seaming swashbuckler or pagan thresh hold
Stomach full of diner food
Wings span cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabbit hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature and it's all peace
When I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain!
This cat is asking if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah" I gave him one last look and smashed him

All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces
Spit 'em at your species
Reachin' the city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night-light got me when the daylight went to evening
Night (Light) Day (Light).. 

Yo, (Alright Ok)
Can I get a quarter or something?
Little hungry, you know what I'm saying? (Alright Ok)
Homeless...
I need a Lucy yo...
(Yo...)

Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
And a city full of horns, jackhammers, and rape whistles
The alley cats manipulate the blocks with gutter magic
Today my heart beats only out of habit
Check it, it's like..
My man Jus used to keep an ox between his teeth
Said he could spit it with pinpoint accuracy if there was beef
We chuckled out loud
Still the thought of it intrigued me, (right)
So now I keep a jackal under my tongue to spit with related reasoning
The earthworm turbulent murder burnout Gerber baby no brain or memoir stardom
Alarmed, pardon the old buzz deader
Robert Crumb ugly dumb image
Barely sprung barely no grimace
Nearly cut cherry blood's picket wrist back in high school (now it's like)
Spy with a millipede pentagon pirate
navigates cities' sump systems
Urbanite turbines
Twisted Pistons
Termites that infect sturdy grillage
There's roaches in the pillars (Spillover)
And crawl across commuter-clean wingtips and loafers
It's the theme park I built
Pocket full of nickels for cigarettes, gum
and milk, bitterness, love, and violence
I'm writing a petition to have smoking as a sport
in the 2002 Summer Olympic Games (wanna sign it?)
Now look, I jux germs draggin a gavel knee deep in a maggot hatchery
Operation capture flag by any means
If this means anything at all, anyway it's a riddle
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels

Ay uh, yo excuse me (Ay Yo) yo
Can I borrow a dollar or something? (Ah sorry man) nickel?
(Sorry man, I can't help you out dog) Quarter?
Something man? (Yeah I only got enough for like cigarettes and shit man)
Alright man, I see how it is (I'm straight)

Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels
And a city full of World Trade Center victim candle vigils
There's anthrax in our mailboxes and Xanax in my tummy
There's a single Spanish female out west traveling the country
Freak of league lazer major running bases
Neighborhood watch weasels pacing ugly acres more than often
If I ever make it big, I'm gonna build a skyscraper tall enough to piss on
cloud 9 egos from my corner office
You can't pull the plug on a catapult (nope)
I toss a nickel to a bum's cup from twenty paces thumbs up
Got twenty ways to tell you shut the fuck up
Nineteen of 'em are 24 bars long, the other one goes (SHUT THE FUCK UP!)
And an electronic daddy long legs stay grimy up in your zoning wall
Groveling villagers, trying to hide behind the windmill
I just got in pig-back through subway tunnels with a third rail nearest
While most still try to penetrate the alligator plants (It goes)
Back in the class, throwing pencils at professors
And making barbarellas giggle
That's when life's pleasures were simple
Now it takes a dancing bear jumping through flaming hoops
to even make em buy the god-forsaken single!
Though shall not desecrate the soothing spiral
Altered by a classic cut to vinyl
Find that in the Bible!
My insult Militia'll fix you up
I'll light the pyramid shaped torso
with your hollow numbskull balancing on top
Now if you got a lock and gas mask outside of your own apartment
You could pretty safely quote Shamar
Life's Ill, sometimes Life might kill, sometimes prayers dwindle
Walk into the store with a pocket full of nickels

Yo (ay what's up man?) Yo can I ohh...
No..Never mind man (I can't help you out man)
Asshole! (Yo man, I'm trying to help myself out right now)
Fucking asked you for a Lucy and you turned me down (Dog, I'm sorry dog!)

Walk into the store, same pocket, same nickels
In a city where every crack in the sidewalk's a symbol
Where there's crack in the basement, where there's crack in the slave ships
Where there's crack whores and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases
My boombox runs on a baboon heart transplant (This is hell!)
I got a poltergeist on a leash trained by Caroline herself
Two Thousand something...
Technology aid itself glutton
Every move I make's from a robot gepetto pressing a red button
It's Vietnam in the fumes
Yes I run with cannibals that bite the hand
that feeds cuz it tastes better than the food
The prickly outer shell's genetic, it helps defense mode
But it also helps to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships
Watch a six legged insect crawl out of the billy goat beard
Watch a sick makeshift bitch threat fall out when the filthy smoke clears
Watch the insect's stinger sting threat till it has sweat a bullet
Sweat a full clip, sweat a river, dead the bullshit, sail away and wither
You're the kind of cat that rolls a pimped out Caddy
dropped with rims and limousine tints bucking Enya
Insert laughter here
I wanna rap a lot and stack cheddar by the fistful
But for now, I walk into the store with a pocket full of huhh...

Excuse me man (alright ok)
Can I..Can I borrow a dollar or something to eat?...
(alright ok) I'm..I'm hungry
I'm saying yo...(alright ok) (Look at that..)
I'm homeless man (Look at that bum) (alright ok)
I fought for this country man (yeah)
Sleep on park benches....starvin'
All I need is like a lucy and like a sandwich or somethin' man..
Wiping my ass with the Daily News man...c'mon man..
Sleepin' with squirrels (Oh my god, What are you doing with that squirrel?)

I spit with an immense amount of power
Skull flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
Ripping ya' craft spoke, for spitting a bad quote
(Blueprint what's your approach?)
I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
Fuck around and forget just how wack it's been
I'm a bad man (Why's that?)
I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And blame David Blaine on any chains that hold us
What started out as food for thought, turned into thoughts to turn they
crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms
Small planets and satellites
You solar system is my condiment
I'm bombin' comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydren
Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
But before you, get a reason to ever diss us
I'll drop a ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer
But this is, the building block of all that is
And what it is, is Alchemy

Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
Alchemy, we made this to take your style under
Metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
Metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip

Ah, dirty, dirty destiny
Birded murders with a burn gurshin a peasantry
Nervous flux flirtin' with hurley burly chemistry
Graffiti burner urchin merchant with a certain urge jerkin' served and centerpiece
My zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline
Ban and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up (I'll tell you what)
Born stylin' 4 dimensions count em'
Breed it take it to em' up, run to build a world you'll never touch
And I'm a pilot, delerium, serum, poison arrangement
?Aroused? when I feel like storming suck the raw enslavement
With a grin-style stinger creeping out the basement
Impatient wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch hatin'
For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist upshielding mother nature
from her fatal wrist cuts story I'll respect you
(So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?)
Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms
Greed even are lease screaming with milestone like ring ring ring I just
caught the screen fiending click dial tone
Welcome to a clouds swell blew to hallucination war pillar
Carnivore, carnival, karma slasher
I dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
To Edward Scissorhands your spring of doubts (Yo turn it out)
This is that mighty case of home field advantage to bend your blizzard With
a crocodile smile and fight robot knuckles to your kisser

This is Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
Alchemy, we made this to take your style under
Metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
Metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip

Count that for me...thanks

One, two, one, two, three, four

Well any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh
Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed
Circlin past the culture's bigot, procreation baked in advanceable
Then ball and scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
I know gerth and nature but recognize absentee ballot
And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void
This game's in the giant Tugboat Complex and HE'S ANNOYED!
(No one's asking you to feel the narc, brother!)
Hmm, it's fashion
I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger wrapped in
Realigned mine knives in divine justice
Plus this uncontrollable laugh with those ample waves of brain finally crash
Brimstone clone with legs and dim poems
Ten little Zen crafts
Things cooperate like paper dog participants litigans
Picket well or ride or burner style clinic
Acid with the basics
P-H imbalance to burn the malice martyrs spaceless
Then fabricate daytrips
I want to be the halo that jumps off the brain
Of the genius who decided some pictures deserved frames
(God and I are on a first name basis)
Yeah I call him God, he calls me Jesus
When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces
Blade, dragon, up hell's creek
Interrupting a devil pagent
Starfighter settling to madness
I keep my ghoul spirit concealed
Until the warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel

My momma told me there'd be days like this
Days like this, days like this, days like this (yes she did)

One, two, one, two, three, four

Okay, tell me who you chill with and I'll tell you who you are
I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar
It's a modern sensation on the boulevard of maintenance
To sweep your broken hopes under the rugs then hug the playpen
This revolution pushing through the loose pins and a strait jacket
A maverick classed in a bunk category
They had him parallel with a tattered glory division
(I could devil drink dreams out of thermos)
Yeah, with a whiskey afterburn
It's like, nine o'clock wake (I'm up) spit obscentities
My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone then work my dental tree
The clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunderchaser set
That got my papergrain's wings wet
Voyeurist amendments lack expansive coverage in the syllabus
I dance with shuckles while you man the keyhole grilling code
I've done my chores according to God's schedule
With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals
Metal edge kings that tends to rapel the pebble
Kettle screaching out the operetta
I live to autograph the iron curtain with doveback feather pens
Spurting magma, cursing television urns to burn until my Cleopatra
Minor (Major) dispersed slap on the wrist
For the tennants lacking the arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship
Stuck with a "Yes sir"
Change of fatigue to ankle
Each beneath the angle
I'ma call home until the rock meets the angels

One, two, one, two, three, four

Diamond cutter spine
Armadillo armor that bends around the blades
Bugs in the beard
Ebony in the lungpiece
Bricks in the Timbs
Bazooka in the tooth that he's flashing at your friends
This is the lifestyle, baby
Know and sip the recipe
Not a single innocuous side up in the centerpiece
Oh my god
Journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars

Piety for the fam, embargo piggybackers
Navigate sim-city backwards
Bazooka Tooth, baby!
Zephyrs less dextrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews
Like jousting Pompeii with a garden hose
If you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping Wagner
It's bodycast to Pilates class
Buckle in the Bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smacks

Drag them prophecies, be them celestine or Mothman to the bumper boat monster mash
See, the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn
Decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
One shan't put in long hours like Tim Leary's lava lamps
To be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
Isolated, biological phenomenon
First nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
Y'all sketch portraits of your neighbors, tack em up without fail
See a robored pitchforks and alligator tails
Offical Max Fischer Blume break cable clipper (Def)
Picket train buffer, the riverboat, and the switcher (Jux)
Pipe-dreaming that so fresh and so clean plummage
Is an appleseed of bore that resorts to Bazooka Tooth shit

You don't want me smiling at your cameras

I cut the ropes, breathe fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke
Load bazooka, scope the culprit hulks over a broken hookah
Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie cut the wattage
Electric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip
Condition the bodega rodent moment composure
To echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen
My 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender
Novelty, I tip lids prior to clipping the comradery
Check the muck out, When metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division
I tug my brim down over my stigmatism
Lo-pro, Paxil Rose, axel broke and butchered
Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
It's King Kong potluck, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms
Just Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam
Serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day uzi purchase
The foundation of their alacrity makes the umis nervous
Me? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker
And um....respect, find out what it means to me
New York, walk blocks with electric ninjas who bark bounce for trunked out whips
Like my company Delorian's the shit
Skipper's out of happy pills again, he's in the neighbors garbage
He's making paper dolls decorated with targets
He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists
Then tearing out the still beating heart from from the loose-leaf carcass
I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic
Built it in three days to float above snarky comments
My gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations
See New York is ancient Rome basic, basically stone faces
My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases
Some of them will blossom famous, some of them will blossom base heads
But they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what!?

N.Y. Electric, catalog, burners, pigs, magnums, crack, bag lady, roach bit, pristine kicks
Threading the iris of the needle. just for my people
Im'a thread the needlem just for my people
Breaker 1-9, 9-11-01 witness, maybe you don't get this

Kill 'em all slow, I was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a C-Rayz-Walz show
Nether-citcuit bacon don't police me anymore, your trained professionals demonstrate
41 shots over par
Least common denominator raise truth like Charlie, Willy, and Gramps
Raise roofs in a glass
Wonkavator, monster maker
Operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter
Talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
Paid dues since before the days of bad acid and Quaaludes
While the boombox talks trash to the richter
Stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
Bitter fucker, nothing is free, I'll spend my last dollar on me
Put one up for my family, should've made time to thank 'em
Put one up for my crew, for recognizing the sanctum
Put one up for the socially broke, choked and smokey
New York piss hiss bleed dolby, homey

I take it Easy

Upside down, I pick wigs for beetles
Pry 'em out and pin 'em to the polar of the see-saw
Sofa cobra shimmy out crater
Cradle my weight in double wishbone suspension
Versus AM clock radio bangers
Downside up in cripple acres and still the fountainhead
Spittle sniglets quicker than quidditch seekers snatch golden snitches
You could be a part of it
Just park your bark at 20 paces
Hold this target and we'll call this bitch a partnership
Man, the city bred the brittle cheapo
Little Lego people squeezing little Lego Polaroid in keyhole
Media breather needy burrow to hide all
While you friends and neighbors press stethoscopes to the drywall
Curl a worm tongue tight, bitten behind the vamp chopper foaming
Lamb choppy sock puppet fear and loathing
Need phoners a.s.a.p. to build careers out of misquoting
So I read Aesop interviews and get schooled on my own motives
It's a pocketful of nickels, like Cool Hand Luke decapitating
Parking meters when the pigs blew the whistles like windmills
I went to jail overnight for putting a sticker on a phone booth
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
How many'd the rapists merk?
Panicky banister silver surf over the wobbles where the potholes
Be the ulcer in the stomach of the God show
You blinded by the light you might just plummet through the cosmos
Meet Apollo sandman function before the whore hit the high note

I take it easy, the ice is thinning in the valley of the jeep beats
And when the freaks come out I hug a TV
Somehow a channel zero bender's less creepy, it's bliss
Repeat with a twist...Easy
When every martian in the market holler feed me
The all city opinion spicket leaky
You learn more when your mouth piece retreat, it's bliss
Now listen to this...oh OK
All day every day, oh all right, all night every night

Whose capitain gon' spew stale venom? Not mine...
I hug a hammock in the bedlam
And when the potentially lucrative race horse gets deaded
I'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings
But I cannot cratchet crutch the Ebenezer limbs much longer
Flaccid flimsy songbirds, classic dizzy wrong turns
For the long term got a dragon all achy
Torn between the lending of a helping five knuckles
And a charter your own escape
Now it's like, sufferin' succotash, bucko, ducks in the chuckle patch
10-4 on that, stinger opinion, wingman double back
Fuck it, Let him roam the home of the mange ridden emaciated
Slave pain cave children game
Not all players heal the same, learn it or don't learn shit
My radio is on regardless
I tune out pardons and tune in starlets
Carbon and pre-David/Goliath live Paleolithic bias
Who walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas
Now it's Thor dwarf war hammers, Elvin bow and arrow aimers
Documentation of the rate at which narrow tapers
Hermit crab, honest cat, trying to raise the roof in my own TV room
And still get the security deposit back
Call Ripley, skippy, motorhead dope fixture on some go to bed no dinner
Hold your head cold winter
Ease up out of the ghastly, desert dozer cliques stranded on cloud 8
Proud of their pogo sticks, I stay left
Along came a spider, sprung and alert, I stay def
He makes records with his tongue in the dirt
Suffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt
Buffer the mighty tighty sequins with a price on the mersh
Covert Mr. Blizzard shoulder, he always acts all pissy
Plus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me
No bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye
Kill it, you are the weakest link, goodbye

Burn train buffers
My fancy
Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
Never give a fuck how far Pi went
You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist

Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
Wookie foot must not sleep
Under the invaders
No batteries
No jumper cables

Wired underagers play box cutter facelift
Rock utter makeshift spirit
To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list

Walk for that
Metal train graf brainiac
Walk for them
Not a limelight
more to blush alizarin crimson
when the multi million
Tin men suck traditional rituals
Out the homes of starving children
And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
Dirty dub vamp.
Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser
Mars attacks colorfulness
I piss raptors on motherships

Hazy days will stay purple
Cause Cips with a Z bargain
Like Crazy Eddie commercials

Go Ah AH AHH AHHH
network with a dirt devil
Burn train buffers.
Hi!
Cute the way your little parasol spins.
Bye!
Suck my Neanderthal dick.
Catapults spit.
Losing the screws and bolts
and all they heard's crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts
Zap!
Radio m-m-m-m-mayhem, fine.
Suicidal eye full of plastic nine.
Bang!

Cave paintings get the natural history feather dust
Pick a lust.

Limo tint stretch delorian chrome sittin on twenties
Then I walk to the stouge, burning my laundry
Lo Pro, fucked up jeans back at the party spinning Kane meets Flight of the Valkryies in a heartbeat.
Saber tooth, catalog, city art, liturgy
Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
And isn't that dope?
The line of blind winged Pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos.
Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
with Joshua for the war gamer systems.

Now the architects are rioting cause we built something different
I'm like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business?

My elephant television was on.
Grape soda, Grape ape, Great space coaster,
DnD, GI Joe, Transformer, Herculiod, ThunderCat, Voltron, Speed Racer, Space Ghoster.
Kiss the flickering images with Carroll Ann fingertips,
C-4 to four chamber skips,
Ohh shit...

They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
Woke first words: "Oh it's like that?"
Started bendin spoons and rippin arrows outa lady hawks
With a C3P unit tryin to interpret the baby talk

Burn train buffers
Right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine.
But you don't like our kind. Do you?
Junkyard Dog. Hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws.

Pain cave uno
Smokin' a broken Blue Note
Tar pit escape artist carcass, linger in the blue doze
Rose radio Lazarus via linear bark screaming
"I'm back to kill the video star and I'm double parked"

You can kite this or yet maybe baby you won't
Corvette, green Mercedes, steady one hundred four
When I'm stuntin', simply stunnin', funkin' with twenty monkeys
They can be like "I'm talkin' about WE"
Slap that orangutan, drop her on her knees
Please be very cautious, the funkin' makes me nauseous
Hate the Bogota, the target it ain't off it's...right here
And the volume's on three

See, we keep the black plastic stuck in the elastics
Even Chevy's heavy hallows lift you higher, legend has it
White crows crossing broken bridges
double deucy clickin' but the round never runnin' out
Pounds of your blood just comin' out

We Limelighters
Up until the uglier unplug me
We limelighters
Kill it now, fade to black comfortably
Spark the dynomite till the limelight's gone
As far as I can see the limelight stays on
And on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight stays on and on and on
The limelight
So we got something built if we all die tonight

She piss champagne and shit caviar
Don't watch the stars, the stars ain't fallin
Any sight of glimmer...Lo
Shimmering king, spring, they're tremb-ling

OK, the web (web) spread (spread) from Brooklynites to born in barn kittens
Who's gimpy half step hid behind Noah's Arc systems
Inconspicuously clustered with the boas, sharks and pigeons
Like Zoo York won't clock them rusted crutches up mopping the ship deck
Texas hold 'em pocket ace investment
Totem altimeter tiki torch it
Freak abort, fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress
That's a sheep corpse who under penumbra turned tail like a sea horse

We got that...permanent ink, that's stainin' the paper
Murderer's drink steamin' my soul, I'm breathing green vapors
We them last of them falcons that's soarin' beyond your altitude
Please show us some gratitude, we're carvin' your grave for you

Hope's a broken arrow stabbing blind through the fog in the log cabin, which gathered and hasn't budged since 9/11.
Give him a couple close friends, a women in his old bed while he waits. He'll hug it all with no plans to escape.

Cook it up, Spooky, Salute, Look
'Zook'll hook it up to shoop the local Wendy Cooper loopy
Low brow, low brim, she asked me, "What's the name?"
I flashed the grossest fang in show biz
Young Valkyrie's open, "What's yours?"
"Um, Jenny, um..."
body clocked in a ten-penny sum
Sprung colossal, miss, may I process your Pentium?
But Ae is hesitating, "My princess,
The pigeon holing roles that your predecessor's lunacy in the kismet"
Her eyes googled back as that of one unfortunate breed
Plus a new kink in the posture
"Just don't get all barnacley
Or Get P.T. Barnumed in 3D THX sound stereo dismissal
Sorry hun, it's just the last few have been a fistful
Like, like, them girls you bump into out dumb luck
get high innocently kiss once when she's punch drunk
Watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch
Crazy Miss Cling-a-lot claim instant one love
And you gotta beg your friends to take 'em off your hands like thumbcuffs
Or them barbies you'll vibe for a sexy second (lovely)
Give it a month; Hyde Heckles Jekyl and she makes Hitler look cuddly
But Jenny in the sky with emerald eyes
You're so different, so delicious, so the fish
I'd be willing to walk the limb with!
So let's just get a few things out the way: (okay)
I'm clinically bonkers and hate just about everyone God's great earth offers
I won't be getting dressed up to impress your family, dear
And if I can't wear jeans and sneakers then I won't be lamping there
Nope, aggro-pimp, sinfully, finicky nova, back it up no-diggity soldier
Magic-touch fingertip donor
Own up to your dirty debutant animalistic instincts
Ritual courting dance and breeding behaviours (like what?)
Like, "I dream of Jeannie and fucking her obscenely"
But Jenny could be Jeannie so easily if you'd let me
Hell, the bad tact daddy-o Merlin-- 'e' for effort
Most of these high-post Fabio world motherfucks make my head hurt
Dead up-- I got death in the skull but you'll get used to it ma
Dinner and cinema, yes, just cough the bread up
Sure, he schleps with naked pockets but I carry dreams
Like I wanna be an astronaut after you marry me"
(WHAAAAT??)
"You're rushing this I feel smothered it's crowding me awfully, dolly
I love you, Get the fuck off me! Sorry." (Call me)
And I'm circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly
"I'm cool, how you feeling Jenny?" (Jenny) Jenny (Jenny) Jenny
"So quiet, ooh I like that, so mysterious, I dig it
The way you haven't made eye contact with me once in ten minutes
I'm just saying girl, I'm dirty-dog raw vintage mixed with mega-low society
Mister gutter-fuck etiquette, try me
So there it is.. game. I mean it's not like I'm sweating you
'Cause when it comes down to it, most y'all females are the same
But now it's your turn baby, spit it out
"Okay," she punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away

Watch out ladies cause you know he don't love ya
Bazooka Tooth is one bad motherfucker
He's a low life pimp with a low life game
He needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame

Cook it up now..

No ring on the finger
There ain't no strings attached
But if you love television and
manic depression
Get a carton of cigarettes
And we can make it happen
Get to mackin'
Just leave your bag up on the curb with the trashcan
It ain't like I seen you in maxim
Relax with the tap dance
Lights, camera, lap dance

Cook it up now..

It goes welcome the pop off, some pop soft. We bang b-bang b-bang bang out loud. Ready on the left with a face full of death. We slanged out fang mouth bang out now.

This is a never dug disco, Zoo York tycoon, memorandum bonanza banter clamp crunk out the fish bowl. Gorgeous how struggling gills wriggle out water, ain't it? Same scape as the walls crawling with paranoia's plaintiffs. The robo-komodo promo Zen patience a-alike to this jittery drooling mess. Bitterly unruly on mud hugger alert, he usher dirt to the kick circus. Deflected labor ethic questions peeled at the field workers. Is it raw? Please... does a priest need a ten-foot pole to baptize little Linus minus the lap ride and tease? Evolution is a leader depleter, seeker needy sheep idol feeder beware, once complete you might not want to be there. Dead straw to gold bar spin fiber. Lost and fond in a smitten kitten's incisors. They Aphrodite all over the burgle of a purple heart compartment. Marched a burgundy carpet alarmed and far to parched to bark it. Lil' Abner. A real firecracker. Grows to throw 'bows with vehicular hijackers. To eavesdrop plots cops hired a wire tapper. That's a whipper snapper trapped beneath my grip on the fire ladder. Took drums over to deril' to once over the line tones. Punch toothy ticks 'til they find homes like three ruby clicks. The roof is on fire where snoopy sits right now. You should have shot yourself in the foot when it was in your mouth.

Thieves in the strobe deep freeze your pose. For the disease that grows underneath your toes holds up a reason y'alls gold never seems to glow. Now we can all breath slow once the fiend's exposed. It goes heave ho. You never got the grit right. Bark fame but you never put the grit down. Hawk styles but you never got the grit right. Put the grit down. Grit right. Get down.

This is a never dug disco defamation of dog and pony grappled out chincey, chipping Leo Da Vinci phonies pushing kill of hill bloated. Nobody got you. While biggest brother's watching bigger brother watching big brother watch you. Nothing says circus fun quite like nuclear holocaust over breakfast on the terrace. Hash browns and peril. Old ironsides or good ship lolli-popper, Davy Jones still got a locker, ak, the opera's more than docs and soccer moms. Now before you kick your feet up, I married and divorced mother nature after sweet-talking that old hag out of a pre-nup. This information's neither braggadocio nor secret, just know as of now the world is technically not yours, peanut. It's a day in the life of the carnie dog-faced boy escapist. Living large, watching Springer, smoking beedies wrapped in bacon. At night his get busy disease leakage peaketh. Merk the he say/she say, BK Jesus turn peg legs to Adidas on the down stroke. And they like 'what's up with the name?' I tell'em y'all made Bazooka Tooth I's about to ask the same. But before you curfew the city and shut down every block, I'd like to say I still Aesop the fuck out of the Rock

This is a never dug disco. Spread feelers. Tonka zonk Gepetto bred beezers. Jeepers, gee wilikers, goshes galoshes, Christ, god almighty. They tore his limbs off kilter, still the hostage moshes slightly. Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche. He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly. He woke, corroded buggy facial, insect chopper biting. He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted. He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking. He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him. He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty. He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely. I alert vital spider works to cultivate grit, ship the bulk rate shit. Herbie the love bug drugs pulsate whips. Tie in spite for commoner idiocy and good old-fashioned biblical plague. We move units off your pagan escapade. And it's pits to the peg legged. Megas eclipse cripples so that pimp limp's wheel chair basketball when 15 minutes fizzles. Your flimsy frame marks hip-hop's second most tragic event and will 'til Jam Master Jay's resurrection and second death.

I brought that genuine shit in '96
Before you knew the underground or independent existed
I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit
No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging
Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
A hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
Everytime I prescribe a new pill, revolution
Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
"Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks
Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from
Screaming out "Independent as fuck" with an insane tongue
With an indelible squad of design monsters
Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus
Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
Imposterous sonics taking the world hostage
Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress
Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn
Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin."
Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences
Waiting way before the four you had laced in
And I was taught to wait patient (Why?)
Only faggots make shit up just to get famous
So when I finally blew up I remained sick
Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement
Back when the independent scene remained faceless
We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix
Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels
Hold it sacred, living it for the culture
Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures
That's why I always get respect from true soldiers
While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop's over."
FUCK YOU, hip hop just started
It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it
Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
New slang, new thought, new sound
Who's heart you thought you had?
You clown, you don't, you drown
I won't dumb it down, I'm dumbing now for these rounds
I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns
You're mine motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds
So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down
My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one
And even though they were soft they had fun
But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
Some of these faggots used to send me their demos
I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels
But since they had no identity from the start
They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold
Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old
I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerve racket
Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard
Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once
And ya'll trying to chase me
You don't innovate because you can't innovate
It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
Keep your identity crisis under the table
I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous

Wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher
And money is an ugly god we all fall for
I got land mammal, cannibal, natural evolving squawk box
That means when I wake up and decide to comprise the new shit
It's not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did
Puff the magic komodo bitch
Rappers stuffed komonos and shark fame at a perfect working unit
Look, I'm done
B-boy, feed that to the needy
Shut your liquor hole, fuck you in 3D

Data-perforated counties making you upset-set

Harvest all Brand-X Clark Kents to worm food
Carbon heart, buried his nozzle in fossil marker art
Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse
And littered volts all over the village where the skittish pigeons molt
Bastard polter-gasps when the pigeon with Lazarus billy-goat whiskers
He roasted sea-salt in the open blisters
But blind anarchy slips through the cracks
See naked martyrs with Bubblelicious on fishing rods itching to pull it back
With that organic invention incubated to have some to make it through
on paper now, a lot of details later
And lot of crews will taper out
A wooly mayor souse, who happy shooting at the bladed mouth
Bazooka Tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers
Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever
Like Punxatawny Phil found with his four furry wrists severed
I walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church
With wild things that make Maurice Sendak question his early works
But no hostages, no promises
Out the clock corporate constant sprockets
Now clocked-off grommets
Running from a rabid ring-wraith click basilisk
Serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
Scrub blood of the AF-152, pick up first degrees
Some toddlers smuggled Tommy guns and crack into the nurseries
Dog, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets (yeah?)
And those ain't twin Beanie Babies inside his pockets (nope!)
2010 sonograms showed the Magnum formed directly out the fetus

Diaper snipers having clock-tower fun
Misplace the bottle, might catch a bad one
Have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young

If this Jesus piece around your neck is bigger than your pistol
It makes homicide okie-dokie and your god will forgive you
Just show the saints at Heaven's gate you should be on the list
"I heard he overlooks manslaughter for a tattooed crucifix"
Twisty, fishy, contradicty, wild animal ship fleet
Off the sliding board dock of the Mr. Turtle pool mom bought
Somewhere they laminate dry bones and cool water and ease medulla
After you thumb-suck and diaper-change get burped and shoot the school up
I'd do it too, but only to exploit no-brainers
Teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra-curricular flagpole scrapping
Amongst tadpoles that have yellow backbones
De-mechanism brought airborne shrapnel scraps to hassle captains
By the itchy index of an umbilically-garped fraggle baby
Fragile maybe, you think?
Chopped shop and a mislead, maladjustee trustee locked box
Hiding clips that light the sky in seconds
like newly communal hop-scotch gives them leverage
Cut them with mortars while I mumble

I used to think I'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber
That or bust the slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder
Self-victim kings who rep a wide pride dosage
For tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches
I'm not a coach
But that won't even jolt the immobile

The moments were subtle but unstolen and guess who owns them
No friendly, non-threatening corporate lacky mucks in the totem

Whose couch is this, whose house is this, who are you down with bitch?
I'm sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit
There was this rabid foot talismen drowning out of my armspan
What's fouler was the other farmhands growing gills and shark fangs
What's fouler was my torso stripped to ribbons in the marshlands
But I'm up now
Let's get this window pane and shut the fuck down
Down by the river where the litter sits
And lionheart critters smoke dope and act like illiterates
I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts and high social maladjusties
Sacred, numb, and boundless went to same proto called cookie
Well, I was dummy to some when my tongue was cradled and my skin looks crazy

And I knew the ph balance wasn't right
And I knew the crash and burn, how to caress it
L.S.D. flashed the message

And I knew the ph balance wasn't right
And I knew how September would then affect it

Lazy summer days
Like some decrepit landshark dumbluck squad dog lurks sicker, deluded
Last sturdy domino leans secluded
Don't let stupid delusions lesson super-duty labor students
Dragnet lifer solutions
Daddy loves sloppy dimensions like son-daughter links
Such determinated leopards, successfully disshelved
Little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking lemmings
Some don't like sobriety's dirty lenses
Some do let sleeping dogs lie still
Don't look so damn lackluster

Yeah
Yeah NASA let's try this
Ah

Park your bets, sharks or jets
These bark mark targets where the barnacles nest
They burrow deep under the carnivores flesh without a trace,
Carnival games, like try to shoot the star out of a space

That's why these grapevines can pop shit to me all day,
I only kick these fucking doors down and make sure the crew OK, like
Food on the plate, pat on the back, kicks on the palette
I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets
While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge
Who light girls and misconstrued the lucky fuckloaders for talent
It's sad really... ok, I'm over it -

Smolder over composure models like
Smoke over soldier nostrils
3-D bifocal goggle broke over catwalkers
There must have been something up in that Long Island tap water
Thru the mute wind storm the hoover and his frisky sissy poodle pack
Oozing that hollow oodle-mac act Ace threw back in junior rap -
Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols when the whole reason you liked em's cuz their shit wasn't recycled?
Caught pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't hurtin', thats no burden
Need attention? Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses
Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin,
Perching little man behind curtain opinions - this is perfect
I'm just like y'all, living low-pro to paycheck
When the landlord hollers they hid the dro in the tape deck
Rocket radio, every success smidgen he harnessed
Parks with wrist and sick wit it clickin' in perfect working ratio
What risk he added dodge blame game for sneaky plots
With elevated rung placement derived from deep rooted jealousy issues
They cued a raging bull and every due is paid in full
With that I'll forget all you motherfucks that fail to pull
Why? well, what's really good?
Not a catcher peddled backwards for a hacker's filthy looks
Hodge-podge phenomenon, muppets available in rubber stamp form
Hogwash Harry clamp norm
Wear the space cape baker, order up
Herbert's pacemaker and vacate personal space in relation to face breaker
Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to ideate with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins

Horseback 60 mph, one hand rollin tobacky badly

We like, 'love it or leave it out your hollerbox now'
Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st some shit went down

Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin
Five Borough fame guaranteed to itch pigskin
Raided near the Brooklyn Naval Yards, juxed an undercover
When they asked him what he pled he said, "You're fuckin' up my cover!"

Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse
Said he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out
Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine
Another dead immigrant, that's the American Dream

Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig
Overqualified with the rent stick
Red brick bash with a texted green screen
Like, "I entered my data right into your screen"

Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman
Sick of pushing skewed information
And abusing the nation
Had a few options:
Either jump or run
Critical ways or waving a gun
Time for C-H-A-N-G-E
Held a knife to the VP on TV
She demanded that the format be expanded
Beyond fear, everybody clear, understand it?

Billy was a coke fiend
Maggie was a cop
Like a dope he stole green
She patroled the block
Banking off his old scheme
She recognized his plot
He thought he was home free
She knew that he was locked
Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car
She pocketed the crack before they got far
Billy watches Maggy from behind steel bars
Like "Where the crack went"
"I'ma smoke it tomorrah"

They call him Larry Luck
Blackjack, big spender
He was married once
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen him leaving Las Vegas
With a pick up truck, diamond
Forty large, and beautiful wife piece
Less than what he came with
Itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
Said "I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents"
And was immediately shot to his death over debts

As Colin died, his mother cried
Then the EMS survived
Said that he could be revived but they lied
Afterlife realized that water from the skies
Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise

Now, J.J. punch drunk, acts like a dumb fuck
Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck
One saw the light, thought it right to rat him out
Now gets raped by Aryans in the big house (OUCH!)

Ted did 20 years for rolling some weed
Though he used to snort coke and dabble with speed
Welcome home, homie, here's a blunt with hash
You know the rules, bitch, take two and pass

I got one Jack or Jill
Jill won't, Jack will
Jill didn't, then did it
Jack fell
No cellophane secrets, b
I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
No cell
But hell, you jump the bar so well
Parted your partners veil and dipped
I'm New York harbor
Tale of a sail, ripped sorta
Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wild
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
instinctual last shout if it killed me
So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free
One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back
Sippin the fits you skipped when shit cracks
They never missed it
Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the same
Shoebox with the flicks and lipstick
I'll love you forever, cuz you know me better
For the record, that one time I would've married you in a second
But kill the rekindling dreams and navigate the friendship
Or else by the time the stress wears out we'll both be dead and friendless

Hey stupid, you're listening to Bazooka tooth, dental cannons, molar pistols; shit like that.
This is Murs, motherfucker, this is Aesop Rock, Ace Rizzle.
Ya know what I'm saying? Check it out, like, Living Legends, Def Jux, if you don't know, now you're informed.
Be better prepared for the next time this type of shit goes down.
'Cause when it's happening and you're unaware you look like a complete asshole.

Every leader dead and its making you upset.
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
set, set, set...
Every hero dead and its making you forget.
get, get, get.
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom.

I'm in and out a pig channel serrated by hand feeders.
Army of vicious kidney patrol yam peelers.
They sleep in barns and whisper looney conspiracy secrets.
Increasing payroll to end is blind, while a.w.o.l. went the leaders.
The only mammal officially banned from food chain
For Finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravating,
Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right,
and he's up nights bumping over crunk and bug bites.
Who luck like this evening. Stay electric mud blood jockey in for the footing.
My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled muppet hearts while sheep tucked deep in the wood chipper.
For the shepherd was a milk carton in scissors. Clammy hands make henna run on risky Jenga tugs.
They're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you!
(Holmes!)
The muck went abacus on labor persperator official biz when auditioning demos by which to live.
No whammies, Stop.
Triple six game never chose me.
Trickery gets hokey.
Pick up stix and ponies.
you've got mail champ: blow me.
Just a trooper with a question mark machine needy
pointed at the heavens like bee gee on some "where the hells my freebie?"
To clamp war stupid.
No land lords or super. no hands.
Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans.
No motor movement no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance. no chance
too many grown men calling in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pinup
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch.

Ain't no time to sit and lift stones
so its left to the dogs to find their way home
and you grew up in a similar generation alone
with fist full of humanoid models along the road
with a frank? in your ancient
fuck if i can find a flesh and bone tour guide to etch me through the makeshift
every little footprints dated and ancient
now Ima step through this motherfucker impatient

for the first time in a long line of dog fights
little Lassy will not be returning home tonight

These lil', lil' fuckin' Martians
You gotta love em' though

Mars attacks wit' electric gats
Not for sapien abduction (what's up then?!)
Billy took a laser to the mug piece; hollowed out the mandible
Channel headquarters order the cannonballs (Mars attacksssss)
We have high demands column to this pigeon ankle
And boomeranging' our harvest; 51st area sickness
Not a threat, an area witness won't injure the promise
Monster lead- carry your ligament fanged in the mosh pit
Dodge vapor, labor days are major A sir
Cater the alien decomposer soldier platter like cabbage check eight
I told her "go for C4 magic's"
Smolder as the Bazooka Tooth holster fabric
(This fucker's rabid and still breathing!) (Hiding cabbage!)
Oh, the heater claps to leave me
I'ma ninja this shit wit' sugar in the fuel tank of the saucer
Buddy up and head down to the metal corporate tunnels
Ice pick the soldered ship wiring; pissed of the mother and um,
I'd be lying if I said I knew your intentions
See my sexy sabotage seeks defensive action to save the race
You land in hand on board to mention magma (Blaze the place!)
Red five revival there's wires in the bible
Obviously, ultra take advance when I point counterpoint
Comparison of ET verse little old freak me (She be on somethin')
Hey riddle sweet peas wit' your nickel PCs; fickle CDs, miserable TV sitcom (typical!)
Pathetic. Ritual. Collective slackership
Beautiful establishment; you aint established shit! I consider you foul
Prowl back to the numbers under burnt pride in the dark (sup yall!)
They want us dead or alive without the 'aliiivee' Part
The sun rose over a body bag shortage
Last week I was like 'god bless the saint that invented the cordless'
This week I saw the re-wrap of the bull's-eye of my worship
Temple body slash bull-cabinet Mastermind diversions (Fuck yall!)
Lets do this shit, my movement soothes any space invader practice
Stomped under enemy like "Hey what now, bitch!?"
Hiding human hear me rise above material and cardinal sin
They shot me in the face

Mars wins

(Puffin' smoke) Run around with your face on fire
(Jet-black smoke on the horizon) Black smoke in the air.
Maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssss wins! (I thought you would like it)
(We gon' make it) Who you screaming at dog?
I got this! (Lets go)

Zig zag zookah, pinnacle stitch
Unleash the unlimited edish primitive piss
I'm singin' cynical maybe the most military ops
Monkey! Here's elephant, and it drops
We on a three-ringed prong ancient elephant tusk
Bitter, at fully (break bread!) you shruggin' it off
Keep it electric, sure, But NY Electra's not about electric wars
Never seen a poor man's glimpse set fake (Last page!)
Three, two, one, domesticate!
In the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny
Sittin' on them Barney Rubble twenties, subtle
Sippin' Saber tooth blood puddle-
I could roll with the lackey's, that's if we hustle
Knuckle in the mud, hell's bells in the chuckle..
Red-berried face means smugger round the muzzle
I'm allergic to the now-born solo panel cutters stole quo to the core (dirt mess!)
Stone cold's hands out core cryogenics, stubborn
Can't talk shit wit' a tongue full a' rug burn!
Bad cholesterol through blood sugar
Four-piece heartbeats wit' a subwoofer!
I'm not asking you to act like you notice (Oh Aesop's SO Mesozoic.)
Now what if in the cabin built the old pulping?
Opened the mirror, stole a pulse with the voltage
Keeping me alive is the vibe with the Vulcan's (hope!)
I'm the divine catapult (Catapult!)
I break it down to the bunk for the crooks wit' the goals of a angel
Eat. Sleep. Fuck.
Structural droids; more bangs for the buck
But they want a last stegosaurs - thorns in the glove (buck wit' it!)
Prehistoric land shark business, cradling the arms of the car man's kidney
Swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier
Beggin' for the freezer burn; back every day sir!
Sir, your science loves to fuck nature
Sir, your right to the dawn of my day sir
Sir, your violent laugh homing beacon's never set;
Who chase till we all catch vapors
Don't call it a sound-off, "Mars Attacks" be the malarkey downfall
It's not a game no more, run from the flash, leave your penny at the door
A lot of magic gadgets; give em' all back just to nullify the savage
Mic's crumble we be rockin' right; in the year of the Troglodyte
Saw a grey mouse rabid poured on a board to the dull morose world like a lull in a storm
And I know you was hopin' that the piece for the ox was a dull sword, ah
(Guess what, it's not!) Guess what else, I transmit from the block!
T-Rex - X-Ray with triple X Hex (give it up!)
For the yesterdays, or the next I can assure you if the RZA got the sword, (dead flesh!)

Aint no time left. (Keep ya head up now)
Maaaaarrrrrrrrssss wins! (I thought you would like it)
Your head will be down in the dirt
We'll end it real quick
Maaaaarrrrrrrrssss wins! (See how strong you are then..)
Your head down with a mouth full of pebbles
That's it man, no time left.
Ya'll keep talkin'. It'll get you nowhere...

Who's that walking with a whole in his head?
Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread.
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives.
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives...
I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed

I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck, gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrestle the fangs off of my fist, flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres on some holiday in Cambodia with moter home appraisers. Pagans fade into the kodochrome now, later with a lid to brow staple revist the cobra landing zone. Molar foaming but he hold his own wound coderized by the Zippo he had stole that afternoon. And my dog tags jingle by the moster island heart he built. Grew up with a Jughead crown tild and tardy slip. Be all you can be just never soothed us. You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush. Holler scum's lullaby. Live from the ultra-fly sham city bunker where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly. Hush little baby, timeout. The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick but lean to peck your eyes out of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths pick on the visions that buzz, bet on the kitten's escape, solder the piston to pump out a veteran amplifier. And magnify through the samelens that set the ants on fire. Flush the muppet hootenanny. Who could fancy honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy? Trooper, scoop the food in pantry. Anti up, stupid. May delusion feed 'em foofi candy and pry the gold out of his when lamping. Pocket all you can now. Block will lead the lambs down to the cold cutlery outfit. Slaughter beef and cow tip. Pour the chief somefountain soda, motor prone to pen the holy opus and pry this monkey off the scoliosis.

Never mind the bullocks. Like every other week these hipster tabloids jumping on and off my sex pistol's bullets. Like every other week he spins the bottle. Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow. Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow, cuz my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile. Fortunate for me it coincides with what comes natural, so the mongrels that I run with turn the 'fuck you's into fast food. Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust, nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his smother's truck. Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag. This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns tend to bubble up. Weathermen huddle up. Today the son of one too many 'yes sir's kings his checkers, watch the double jump. Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down to the last diseases, it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister. Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard. I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging like serotonin weekends were merely comedic hazing. Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace: kill every motherfucker but me. You cool with that? Cool. Bang. You? Cool. Hang. You? No? Uh... bang? Cool. Sorry, dog, rules is rules. And too long have I followed yours. I'm trying to get them years back, and walk through every cipher with dynamite in a beer hat.

Deliver us from evil
Litter bugged amoeba simmer on the brimstone
Grim tone, bring him home
Authoritative restoration will be rationed righteously
To those deemed suitably fit to police their own sobriety
Standard law that wriggle intimate, mingle with coincidental mishap, then snap
Curse the digs
Yellow brick Zooka birthed the piss
I trust that every litigant will be his own worst pig
Thirst big, baby, I reckon y'all are a mess too, but insecurities will
Make your bio sound less cool
If fizzy lifting drinks are par for saddling your horse,
You might consider sawing Sea Biscuit off at the knees before
Few chew sacred like them sewer cougars
Patient 'til the Lugar movers daytrip with them super cookers blazing
Divvy up the remarkable carcass, what a relief
And y'all ain't even washed yesterday's blood off your teeth
Behind the buck-bin Duane Reade aviators plated with the dookie brown tint sit
The googly off the daily paper
Clip red or blue (Blue!)
Either way the shredder chew
Letter to the editor messenger, let him through

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

I put a beetle on his back and take notes
Play a dealt hand. Kicks wing tips 'til the tank flips conveyor belt
Shelf a mayor saber for catering navy savior
Help who treat stray children like clay pigeons off the sailor's deck
He squeaks 'pull', I freak the wool over the owl eye;
Filter sheepish winter through it's sister on the outside
Meanwhile back at HQ, he's twisting his moustache, hatching a plan to hate you
Shark fin dollar pay a ghost guild buckets
Hard pill to swallow and he knows pills, trust him
Drunkards of the crystal palace suck assignment
Walk the diamonds in the soles of your chukkas back to the slaves who mined 'em
It's Raggedy Andy clan; fancy the pretty stitches
'til he learned the skinny on the fragility's physics
Like he snag a button eye on the fly by the barbs
Super glue the parts, now his students are alarmed
No worries, it's snow flurries compared to what the sheriff wish:
Curfew the city that must not
Bust warn shots at a run-of-mill Waldo on a doctor hunt
He will make the most wonderful sarcophagus occupant

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said uh, un-gowa, we got the power
Automatic systematic engine number nine, sock it to me one more time
Said un-gowa we got the power
Okay, do your thing
Family, do your thing, do your thing, stop

Rotten egg, not to be pegged as fashionably tardy
The difference is the latter got the freebies from the barkeep
Wait, Aes-fucking-Rock is in the building
The room looked up, looked down, kept sniffing
Slit the neck and slip the chip in, sipping anti-governmental zombie grog
But zombied up gladly on your Swiss Army watch
As if twitching upon your authored condition's
Really that different from administered conditioning glitches
Kissing a firewater pitcher with the fatal Drano-chase game
It's hiding in the Nang labeled with the day-glow face paint
Some buckle when the T-Rex treks shakes the puddles
My huggable jungle
My son of a dove cry, humble, even doves die
I took the black outta something to judge the lung by
I took the mag out like the crack out of a bum's pipe
I hook the tag up like a flag over the plum sky
Mud pie cruiser with an oink for the innocent
I blame it on the ambiguous quote unquote system
If a quota needs some filling you're a whore
Sincerely yours, engine number nine conductor
All aboard!

Engine engine number nine, sock it to me one more time

March
The more the merrier
Get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
F-R-E-S-H
Fresh to death and keep it def to the left
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

Delicate freak show alert the frame
Bash all flags where the mag spin park
Corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
Boogie down kits to slip past the guard
Def with a mascot of radical mass
Megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz
We are not trained to divert the crash
But march face first with a prayer for the blitz
Stand up for the cinema fire, simian ire
Cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky;
Intimate eyes loop all known alleys
Scoop the bounty like daddy hires Bazooka to murder Ralphie
I curdle with burnt milk, pariah sigh, honor piranha money
Count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper tummy
One of these rebels could level the marked city
But the N.Y. uber alles governor's picky
I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with
Ultra, soldier poach the folklore
Jump guns through the ninth gate
Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
Even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage,
Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
We bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot
Plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox
Wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop
Boy meets vermin: the widescreen version
Headaches, nausea, vomiting, facial paralysis
These area a few of my favorite venomous side effects
Mamba, Water Moc, Pit Viper, Diamond Back,
Anaconda, Boomslang, Cobra, bite 'em back
Spinal tap crabs to the clapper
Aesop Rock is the Cadillac of natural disaster
Push that button
Everybody gotta push something
That's why the envelope is where it wasn't
I work with the builders, whittle my gorilla military
And fizzle 'em through the vigilante filters
Who lamps left of the toggle?
How'd they fit that ninja in a bottle?
A hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
Verse a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down

Get up, get down
Sit up, sit down
It's either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds
Face up, face down
Laced up, laced down
It's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

I was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
When the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers
Would have said 'curb it' like any nervous habit
'til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres
And labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters
Oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers
Fuck it
Want a carnivore war? Bet
I'll be at the Bronx Zoo with a lock pick kit
On the eject for cockpit bench, helicop clip
Nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
Roger, hop-fence-kill-a-crop, monster
We are the tired and poor, we come for your water
Boom!
Bounce when the church corrupt
When the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs
When the stars finger babies like I flirt with sluts
You'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up
Metal kettle unsettling treble howl, settler trembling
Measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine
Never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
'til it's pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after
And U.S.A. on a Ketamine disaster
Cane for stress
Crack if the former left you unimpressed
Now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball, but damn
Kumba-fucking-ya, dog
Terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought,
Prepped package of the slickest spin-doctors
Raised where the paranoid hide tools proper,
Like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
And it looks like war, quacks like war,
So it's Occam's Razor and I'm swayze out the door
A hundred million motherfuckers hold me back
The hand cannons won't ask 'bout your zodiac, boy

Get up, get down
Sit up, sit down
It's either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds
Face up, face down
Laced up, laced down
It's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
Well it was Capricorn, Virgo, Aquarius
(Check!), Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius
(Check!), Pisces, Libra, Scorpio, Aries, Gemini, Taurus
Let 'em die for it

(Give him one of these pills if he has any pain)
(A parable....What is it? Well it's a little story with a lot of truth
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincere, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...)
(Yeah!)

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brick fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
Would someday rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost
(I knew it!)

Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughters
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You can not pay you bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck (Oh my!)
Shut this fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
and mommies Madame cliche generation Agnostic front
It ate the nifty fate, the 1958 before the New-New Testament approved altar-boy fistic rape
And "take me to your leader" lung as he dope manipulate toddler-fever (Leave him alone!)
Call me crazy but I'll bet that wasn't God's demeanor
Saw the meter peaking (Me too!)
Along island was Jesus every weekend spoon-fed to appease traditional love bringing
of a little Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle {How?}
One church with a fate and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And mangier staff is swung as Santa ate the cookies (Well...)
When I was a saint paint with snakes in Belize
said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool-G!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a (FUCK!)
94' Moved out the crib and it ain't seen a steeple since
What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch
'till priests slack, slapped with parental advisory warnings
I'll be auditioning God's in my office on Monday morning

(Yeah!)

Uh oh! And yet another pill slipped
down the hatch and pass 'em through the kill-switch

I need a couple A's for Q's
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused

(This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and helpful
to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people:
Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food
When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me
But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you?
Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered:
In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren
You have done it unto me)
(Yeah!)

Just a little bruise in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask on them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Aes is just another cynic-brick in Hell's basement
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
For what? Drugs and fuck it, It's part of growing up
Like cups over dumb shits better than the schools
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme
So its a no-brainer piece when the blood hit the screen
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo from horns
The more science invade, the more the karma than bread and booze
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused

(You know what Aesop, to be completely honest you're a fucking asshole) 

Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent Zip-Zooka swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE
Walkie-talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers: 20 (Ha!)
Tug a noise/annoys box-trigger reporting for hunting

I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

up in a killer horse, numb and bloodthirsty
'Till the uncle spitter beg the pig to hug mercy (Ha!)
240-below shit, kickers tickle the corpses (duck!)
Duck the widow-maker, also manufactures swords (ok...)
Manufactures ornaments, if it moves stick a fork in it
Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates
Unfortunately, courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
Whose aimless nature bait a holler taste the martyr's skin
No semper-fide (Nope), no saluter units
Soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfer
And when the automatic-jitters wiggle the ribs
I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped (Bang!)
Sun down, goggle up; canteen gobble-juice
Teargas nozzle up, brain buff hostile youth
Chop it up, lock a noose upon it
You will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it
But it's big! Big and legitimate
Justify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds
So he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47
Clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!)
Muddy-gut snake eyes, she approaches cobras with an ugly muck
And bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines
Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?

I have landed safely
I have not recieved my papers
I have zero natural enemies
I don't know my location
I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)
I was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
And the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in
I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
I'm calling for my orders, over
(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)

I shimmy up out of the fox
Hold the sword of the only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled
(There is no course iller than no course at all)
Okay, if his perspective is smirked, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt 'n' sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)
Now I'm set in city looking for something to puncture
Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)
But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles
So he list the little boy into the pin-up pineapple (Heh)
Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe
Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)
And just as fast as the parachute cable snipped
I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed
Link a baby pulled around the standard issued weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory
They will step over the body for the looting..
(Ready on the far end line)
(The fuck is that?)
STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!

Smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills,
Guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills
Hollring 'no I don't immediately ameliorate 'em
I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em, and rate 'em, see if I hate 'em

Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top
The tweeter meter blew code def hones in
I pack a lunchbox, walk to the stoning,
Jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning
I'm irrational, paranoid, tragic
And the button on my chest says 'panic'
Punch it, hold up, don't touch me
I'm a savage from a rabid ass country

Who want to get it?
You all acquitted
You need to quit it
Getting evicted, you little idiot, pitching tickets
It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits
Body you up at the party, somebody get his mistress

You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart,
Then you kick back once the inertia start
And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark,
The serpent's arch alerts every circled shark
See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm,
And when the first arm's found we observe the art
Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb,
Rather kick when the face already raped by the worms

Tasmanian pain coast, ridin'
Very little to say to these politician behind it, but this:
You better loosen the noose or lose livin'
These little kids walking the ave. quick to produce a biscuit

Now you should medicate any area that the pain hits
And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers
The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos
They be looking for any situation they can play on
Respectively injecting these thoughts, detain us
Negative speaking, they be creeping, they entertainers
When you out of data they run through a route that'll save ya
In retrospect, infect and pressing your papers

I design kill pain cave penmanship
Federal analog hog unedited
With a CUNY degree in young numbness
Angels on the rooftop, gun in they trumpets

I was buried to the neck in them all-start bloopers
Periscope down, hop Boss Hog cruiser
Porcelain or pewter authority wil be over ruled the second jukie uber alles news hit the sewers

Rickety rackety
This city fit my style exactly
With a backspin, and the fat laces, Gazelle glasses, chase rap daily
Rickety Rackety, this city fit my style exactly
Near the train tracks, in the garbage bags, where the cement cracks, we a part of that
Rickety rackety, rickety rackety

When you take 2 to the vein, introduce 2 to the brain
You don't get used to the pain. A maniac bruising the cage
When cats rush you in the public you be like 'do it again'
He's a motherfucking bloodsucker, he can do what he can

On the side of the block, do the bus stop
You paying a fare?
That's a trust fund.
Little ugly ass duck, life's a fun fuck
Too battered to rush, I walk punch drunk
And the whole world is yours now
Before the steppers are goosed kick your door down
I'm in the getaway whip with Aes Rizzle
He got the same shit stitched in his missles

Okay, lefty field... stealth
Dressed to kill... self
Megawatt with a horizontal neck spin swim funny to vertical bobble head yes men

When the evil falls in it draws to the pours, it gnaws to the core
It's precedented that you represented a percentage
That wasn't vintage and the crawlers hate us
You automated, we brought the flavors, niggas you ought to hate us

And even from antagonity squad the family tissue
Testify the look of my eyes, genuine issue
I'm a freak in the flesh that penetrates lust
Spray the vaginal juices, like I was up in their undies

Don't picket the misfit law, Nancy
The core's no picnic
Mislead whores advancing
No business
Insist lured with candy to cure citizen x with that all-rours dancing
Corporals landing ashore, all soar boned nitwit, rickety rackety porn fancy
Weave through the hell and high water hot zone,
Diseases in the minute the idiot got home

Now I'm a teacher, first grade, and I want to participate
I want to grade the papers but I don't want to give them A's
Okay, F, D, F minus, test time, set timers
Call every parent and give 'em a piece of my mind, shit
Cause I don't want to give a good future, I'll shoot ya
Shoot ya?
With an uzi filled with rulers
Fuck minors, flush minds
Even leaving 'em bruised up
Stack kids, pack cute lunches in the cooler

Rickety rackety
This city fit my style exactly
With a fireladder, with a wire scheduler, drink for the reek fish, smile after
(Rickety Rackety) {Rickety rackety}
(Rickety rackety, this pussy fit my dick exactly
With a threesome, giving three?
Sex, drugs, girls?,)
Rickety rackety, hold it!
{Rickety rackety}

Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans
Food, clothes, medicine
Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators
Food, clothes, medicine
I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates
Food, clothes, medicine
Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull
Food, clothes, medicinal
Variety, for every plastic orange bottle
The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think
Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get
When bourgie hopes hellions,
Food, clothes, medicine, alumni,
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar
Let's bet it melts together
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff)
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box,
Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager,
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee,
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me
Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents
Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine
United we stand to all our parties click,
I divide and conquer cause frankly I'd rather sit
We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces
Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers
Now Major Aes route the following order
To all his crew's chromed generals,
Food, clothes, medicine.

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars,
Like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours

We role tape protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence
Food, clothes, medicine
Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger, 90 moves choked citizens
Food, clothes, medicine
Well y'at's a quick example accept as commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent
Food, clothes, medicine
It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin
...
I'll bite the hand that feeds
Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back
Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck
Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium
With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom
Save me some, scallywags hold your breath
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death
Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch,
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters
Through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin' cliff's notes vendors
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicate
Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it
Zinger!
Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup
Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks
Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up!
Food, clothes, medicine, cause hungry, naked, sick, sucks!
Collide with worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance,
And curb them harp love bugs by the cursive final curtain clamp
Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth
I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars
Like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours
Food, clothes, medicine

Good evening!
Alright... Yeah!
Happy to be breathing...
Yeah!
I am alive...
Yeah!
(I am alive...)
Yeah...

(You look like you've seen a ghost.)
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)

Most copious
Rain soak the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly on the lawn
Let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking this water for too long
So when they gather by the birdbath in the morning he will tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect, but you have all outstayed your welcome."
Interesting, in a sense...
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like, "The dead don't argue."
Said, "You're living by the bayonet, but how alive are you?"
Shit, 'A' is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table, lobster bibbing on the ready-set
He said, "But how alive?"
"I don't know homey, you decide."
("No, you decide.")
Fine...

How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...

And one by one around the yard, till each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?)
We the legends that home with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh...
Money's in the market for a mother ship
Double as a vessel that drag it's legacy under it
And who am I to hang them out to dry by the heap?
When if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The too alive channel from the library of rivalry
And summer's in the mud, winter's by the tracks
No story goes untold, Aes is back!

I got a handful rocking the same poker face
Down to dance around the table like they own the place
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)
I got the whole world thinking it's a holiday
'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)

How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...
How alive? Too alive...

"Aesip Rock"
"Easep Rock"
"Easep Rock"
"Here's a bra"
"Say it really loud."
"Easep Rock"
"Easep Ro"
"Easeh Ro-Ro"
"Easeh-ehhhh Rock"

Flash that buttery, gold
Jittery, zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole
What a patrol...
What are we to Heart Huckabee?
Art fuckery, suddenly?
Not enough young in his lung for the waterwings?
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'm a pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt."

(Fine...)
Sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot it's a feast. Let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by "The Funhouse" cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like, "None shall pass."

Now if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
'Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz

(Fine...)
Sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more!
Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold."
"Let it break the walls of Jericho."
"Ready? Go!"
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by "The Funhouse" cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like, "None shall pass."

Okay, woke to a grocery list
Goes like this:
Duty and death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jet pack strapped where the backstab lands if it can

(Fine...)
Sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've... struck a nerve so they huff and puff
Till all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
NY chew through the machine...

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by "The Funhouse" cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like, "None shall pass."

I was a dark, dumb student
No hooky rookie day trippin' on visions of chickens that look like R. Crumb drew 'em
They grew 'em in a royal dirt of Suffolk county's flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushin' sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slipped through the pinholes
'Zook slipped through the pinholes
Crispy the godsender who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender
Both the formal squad censor
Look down
Either side across the marsh before it was "Awesome cars!"
My calling card Calvary cooking an '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back, barely
Equipped with Super-Soakers full of piss and an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid ... his ring king dummies to King Kullen, where he hollered "Fuck the world" from a parking lot in the suburbs
(What's this?)
A couple spray cans and a little litter but they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck 'em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe
I'll be there when it happens
The shakin' of the plates off the mantle
The snakin' of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
Admitting the mistakes to their deplaning cadavers
Now it's "Rest in Peace" Will Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn, doggy
Good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the corporate banks.

(What's this?)
I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle up fantastic labor
When the towns be freak sleep
Trap the traitor
He will ask for papers
(What's this?)
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little nuzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with ?gators
He will catch the vapors

Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shoveled his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean and triplets, pick a winner
Took a couple summers pukin' pills behind the dumpster
As the largest pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in the soupy gutter
One shoe in the velvet heaven?
Where the mermaids Harlem Shakin' by a lake of melted weapons
(What's this?)
You could dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who will be patiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift?
Extra
The days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah
I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
Sparky nails pig stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
They chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem
We responded like a snow day
It was clobber shit to flotsam
'Till the cops said it was okay
Okay
Show the squadrons back into their boxes like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughin' awfully at their often
Flood a parking meter fever, knucle up for Love and Rockets
It was rain of the razor laser
Day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter
You can bow without me

Knock 'em out the box, Ace

This is my friend, Tony. He's pretty cool.
Although he's not always so smart.

And then there were eight (then there were eight).
Just like that.
(Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto).
In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me
a bet, empty the rent if you can double-park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers, sold him out

Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma cloud
Solar boy elope with couch choking on older Polaroids
Motormouth show for the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish outta water he grows lungs and multiplies

Idol. Once soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
If mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps

Maroon the traitors, expecting anchors of edelweiss
Who later learned it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing, (an accomplished dickweed?)
Nothing, nada, nil, I stuff a lot of pill to gut.
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
He'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
Buf if I'm not?

Fuck it.
Plug him, Warpy got his goddamn groove back
Jet setting on spec with a dead
The eddy on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man,
Freak a little witch hunt.
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities amongst sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice imaginable right before you
All I thought of was the cloven hooved
And how the clip-clip-clopped over the woven roofs
With a nose for commotion and stolen goods
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
In the meantime
nine minus one left eight
In the meantime
nine minus one left eight
In the meantime
nine minus one left eight
We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate

They're gonna want his milk money next.

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and grow
Forging of laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
(Someone should finish theese!-Zane)

You ain't shit. This ain't ill.
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still.
This is a corpus full of pills, trying to sit still and build.
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell.

"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm, burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

Hey, tequila to free the worm
Had his liver scuba suit up on the Sabbath
His personal pill rabbit
At the hole's end her delicate mitten tipped
For sticking pissy liquor in him every day at six
Silly, predictability is a bitch
Fully patterned, had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board
She said, "This is less of a fixer-upper than my last bar."
"Funny, you're less of a fixer-upper than my last whore."
Crass is Similac to the milky with of today's youths
Both chuckle out
Next couple on the house
Next couple on the couch
Swapping social coma rants
Phobias and soldier doubts, jokes and corporate mogul bans
Motor-mouths
The key to open his closure:
Pussy plus yay; she hid in a broken toaster
And later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly
Tooth, nail beauty through the skin deep

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist
If pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff
And cigarettes, and pills on a speaker
Silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety Venetians
Between tweaks, he sweeps at home depot and reads
Mostly biblical, but not 'cause he believed
But found the lexicon of Jesus-heavy literature fly
Feverishly sponged up the information high
Fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck
She pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back
Plus, the depressing sum of the two combined pay checks
Stung less when little Debbie D-cup put her legs back
Drunk, put her on the business-end of his favorite couplet from Corinthians
Sunk into the comforts of a kid again
Enough to share the stuff that truly interest him
This is where the vision of a shiny, happy Christmas end
Tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him
The more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates
Assuming it was them against the world into oblivion
But he was just a stupid simian that her live with him

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

Pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies
In the valley of the irritable Aggie
Any sincerity, miracles, or memory buried in the back-seat
By the hazardous materials was seriously gasping
Here he is in action trying to patch up the attraction
Figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion
Penned a couple chapters 'bout a sassy pair of magnets
With a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage
Never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language
Was fashioned around the aspirin in his cabinets
Asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact
This is an exact imitation of how she react:
"You ain't shit man, your story's a joke
You should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope."
Man she knows five chores, more coke, and all fours
Said, "Leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door."
Bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum
Consuming every skull and crossbones in the room
In under two minutes, he fuming with a flipped lid, stormed into the crib
And found her body on the tiles like, "No she didn't!", yes she did

Stay awake little misfit
Her lips wet a very particular mischief
Sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
Or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead

An object at rest tends to remain at rest
And an object in motion tends to remain in motion
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
With the same speed... slow down
And in the same direction
Down... down... down...

A yo, I send this to all of my corporate
Corpses tryin' to abort the thoughts of coming out wildn'
Dumbin' out time to off the office, I was surely sorta
Twisted, worked at a TV studio, an audio assistant, easy

Do my duty though at times was in a mean mood
Hot I gotta be cool, on the brink of fiend's drool
Glaring at the green room, made a brother the same color
But beyond neon, pushin' me to peon, barkin' at dreams to be gone

Tending to the talent and many they haven't any
Was especially a challenge when he be like goddamit
Can he hear his vocal as he cuffin' it, "How my mic sound?"
Thinkin' on the low it's perfect when he put the mic down

Clown stand steady grillin' wanting subservience
Sound man buryin' thinkin' I'd fuckin' murder them
And I'm steamin' as I'm watchin' duke, leavin' on some hot pursuit
I gotta win as these cats be modelin', what not to do?

6 in the morning and the walls close in
High noon calls and the walls own him
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win

Storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore
Gore is my harbinger, pardon the art of war
Get your doors darkened by the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a sparticus and more

Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still a buck is a buck and he punch numbers five punch
Just say no to company functions and he duck into the dungeons

Nothing says, "Kill it" like a day of fetching
Paper-clips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives one is chores for whores, one is
Where I want to be when you begin regretting yours

And I poured in with a large coffee
Tardy every morning to a man who
Took authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent day job free?
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace

In a hospital gown day off
From being tied down in recreation
Swinging a paddle at mental patients
Raping the competition to smother the pain and sin

So he pounds you out in table tennis like Wang Liqin
Too strange within just to stop demented interactions sleep
And thoughts documented
He's lingering insane paint thinner in his vein

Colors blown out around the doctors finger
In his brain with a needle unable to beat him
In a fetal position he crafted a path to escape his condition
Would cling to the white walls the psych halls in his mind
Soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time

But not before more injections strapped to the bed
Until the psycho-tropics took hold of the rap in his head
When his wrists released he wrote tunes you could snoop through
Day of release said depart from me I never knew you

Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the monkey keeps talking, keep
keeps-keep-keeps talking

(Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a beat
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, proper to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo of what we sold choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, the divide up of fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires {Money money}
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities and the one is broken up in tiny towns
And I won't pose, I'm in the heart of the lion's throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War tore the symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

Another dark night, another not-all-right
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

Money

Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks
We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Duke, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon fed
{Money money}
Money is cool and I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit
(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warmed sugar water wore the summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber necks froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feudal group the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers mold it where the Jones is every grown up
Want the code again to get to grow in
No motive, it showed up in dose quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked through fancy
Which swayed with stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in {Money money}
Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Chronicle the loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-massed flags, half caps stole the properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

Another dark night, another not-all-right
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

This-is-the-life
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking
This-is-the-life
Talking
This-is-the-life
Money money
This-is-the-life
Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh)
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go)
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigate him starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!"
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones

Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish

"What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered
Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar
He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side

Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he feud and he brawled
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out when they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth

Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat
Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid

Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land

I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails
Remember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales

Dead men tell no tales
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie, throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die, motherfucker, die!
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership;
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason, but not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fires' catalog:
40 torched orchids and citronella for Algernon
Don and Vagabond, alike, repent
This shit should have been, "Beta burns Babylon. The End."

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before
They said...
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost, baby, the future is so bright
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

Nothing says "charm" like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs!
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming, "Keep your mouth closed. Keep your cows cloned. Go!"
"I am the pulse of this fucking town, homes, no!"
My, what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop, and a million watch Gideon scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage (amongst the classes.)

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before
They said...
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost baby, the future is so bright
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

The mobile infantry is so postal
Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete
Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens;
Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies
Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect
Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas
Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons
Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers
Who broadcast 80 million versions of the sermon
For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma
IMAX, city-wide transfer
Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement
Ease into the "Xanadu", let it hammer the tension out
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal
Monitor face to the wall opposite
U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song
While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long

And when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
To murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before
They said...
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

And when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
No love lost baby, the future is so bright
(Kill... television! Kill... television! Kill... television!)
(Difficult... isn't it?)

Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch so chicanery
Was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each
Others queens, packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the cameras
To capture the damage, neck swivel with a chomp chomp volley
Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra peace for the better
But it wasn't entertaining, so they waited for the tazing
From the safety of his haven, like bees to the honey when they lumped you
Up, cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
Know that...

Tune to "Hellemundo" for action packed blasphemy
Big city translate your face til it atrophy
I let the schadenfreude boy out actually
Deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly
(Yeah bitch) Pass the P's it's a laugh in
I can smell the tragedy
When hatchin', happily dispassionately patched in
Alive with the menace of demise
Like, "Yes!" the pain dazzles men, pass the popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) It's reality at
It's fastest, and yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses
I guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us
Wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
In the corridors of entropies wars contort drastically tilted fits
I adjust to climates of the wilderness, walk along my spine take the pilgrimage
Up in to the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses
Work you motherfuckers (hooray!), there's all day to die, innovate the mayhem with grace
The good-form-fall, fuck if I'm a warn y'all, nah
I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
Sixty thousand watts of that raw
"Pull the claw out of the trunk" fun, each one teach one how to club one
Look at how they bathe up in the dove blood
It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud...

It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace
It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained
It wasn't daisies and crazy
Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves
And saints, and every trainee face-painted while his great
Escape grazed and ate
He'll never make it, when he aims he shakes
And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door
With a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Clap clap, encore, monkey in the middle study
How the bunker took the missiles, age of machines with nary a green
Screen, so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems
I could tell the pet from the vet, money where his canine's spread
And never welshed on a bet, that said, know the over-under
On your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow-maker's
Numbers every summer, bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release? em?
Has he mercy, will he hack 'em to pieces?
Is he dirty, will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry?
And nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies
That hop around drunk in the land of a hundred Mondays
God damn, pop the redenbacher proper and
For Christ's sake get this man a doctor!

Take take, the medicine tastes great
Gotta keep in the city I'm way baked
Waiting for the meteor shading at twelve begin paint
The origin of a deeper leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rope toddler
Rebel of refrigerator
Give him a Nilla wafer
No role model, provoke him to shift focus
Cus he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest crooks
All? get from an honest person
Bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in the box in the yard
And the bark is far from a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent
Prefaced the grand canvass
Dance to the dirt
Stand up, celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung til it's done
Ready set kept it
He thefted a post-it
Later applied the motives to a moment of some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the gm
Or you carpe the diem
Warplay the porn game
Wanna get the sure way
Well the freedom will correlate with the sword play and heathens
Trickery I'm back, talk
Fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk
Of the modern bright slide rule
Every last number in it's history
Got it's own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory, Thanks
Bathe in a bottle of your finest
Huckleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
For that hell appears to that in your climate
Get your money from the richest Seek your pussy from the flyest

Slow and low, Do or die calm
Suicide king and a tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die, stuck
Two to five cans in the trunk of the truck
And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
Capture the flag

One by one like little confused penguins
Larceny's yes when fools used weapons
Like a bitter little burgular jaded up at the buckets
He's dumb enough to pull up in public in the fuckin thing
Nope gotta configure the five fingers
Sorta hop wire vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor relieve the initial rush
Like, step over the abysmal cusp
Matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fucked
And make you read the mud, maybe make the stigma's crushed
Like "he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums"
And this is certified milk by the department of skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than ya shutter speed
Click! Missed, dip dumb colory
In another muddy river water til the rudder bleeds
Skip around the money Peel the color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed
Gutter greed king
Let a crumby motherfucker breed fuck with me
It goes knock knock, rummy at an abrupt speed
The seed's all growns up, playing grown people games
Evil lames grown encompass the whole paper chase
Grip, better get the master plan
So when the workers of a secret graph expands,
Yes a pig is a cop, I got a villian for flock, so when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies will watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cus opportunity's fickle If they we're trickling Stop!
Capture the flag
Drag that crass little bastard flap through the hazmat glass
Laugh when he asks for it back
Scratch that
Welcome to the magic and a basket of cash

Slow and low, do or die, calm
Suicide king and a tuck of the palm
Slow and low, do or die, stuck
Two to five cans in the trunk of the truck

And these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
Capture the flag 

For want of a nail the shoe was lost
For want of a shoe the horse was lost
For want of a horse the rider was lost
For want of a rider the battle was lost
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost
And all for the want of a horse shoe
There is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
If you would clue the crew into the civil
Just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged and nautical seas
And I would stop the violence more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
A is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties
Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Haties
And he brazen but apparently infernal bound now
For when a man had coughed recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
Observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day
All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
When he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
To treaty to sign
No city to guard

I pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
Holmes, the barnicles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into suitor's capital to a beggars hand
Comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
Umm, what?!?
The chinny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
All kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
If he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground
They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
Dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east
Now the wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miled high

No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
To treaty to sign
No city to guard

And all for the want of a horse shoe

I limped up like a dog, shut up, with three legs to the stage...
So many dark hearts to choose
You can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Tune into the brooders of the dark heart news

Breathin's a tug of war
Wet when I rust a ball
Plus twenty nine bust gum stuck cluster door
Slumped in the back burn (Bush) by the son of +George+
Sweat terror feed cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bobble is a pot of claws clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs? parimass? bells
I don't speak the language but my last laugh's hell

Spiral your vertigo
Signals that flash and beat
Postin' my head from myself to get back to me
House full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts mad as the magazine
Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall
A threat, a break, a mistake with the post
Picking every last fuckin' piece of paint off the walls

Okay, notably mobile until social
He will locate every exit in seconds to flee the wormhole
When emergency diversions ring the celly or the doorbell

Burnin' it at both ends, friends let's commiserate
Turning into something, to the sound that the triggers make
Born at the badder side, I had this time still await
Trainin' all my zeroes to perform like they're figure eights...

Whether you levitate or bend spoons
Extra extra read all about it

Hey, four corners of the globe, all invent fire
On the very same day in the very same cold
Each sent a man with a torch to the borderline?
Watch them collide and explode

When I hear them blind up jumped the iron cord
Funky wrench in my hand, raise it cut the islands off
Homemade tats memories
I ignore the private calls
But ever since the eighties I think something's in my Tylenol

What plague makin' out on the brigade
So we could walk planks
Then we'll climb a tree and wait
Irony is waiting over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed
I'm gonna live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint (Right)
See the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks (Right)
Can't hold howls and corrals with a key,
So will the worms please drink on the count of three (Three!)

If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep,
I could buy a billion locks and finally read a book in peace
No more would my president come off as a crook and thief
And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me

Sideways eye on a sinister boundary
Peddlin' contemporaries killin' me loudly
99 bottles of beer on the wall timorous
Done run akin to the car on the lawn cinder blocks...

Whether you levitate or bend spoons

Three legged dogs that chewin' the wrong food
Riff raff fallon?
Land sharks throw the date money money booze
Dark heart news...
HAAA!

Extra extra read all about it
"Extra extra read all about it"
"At the bottom of our news"

We don't need no walkie-talkies
Nope, no walkie-talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no
We don't need no walkie-talkies
Nope, no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be...
First to immerse in the pass-out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
Till he woke up drowning in Tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw:
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he authored a law;
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf
I mean, that's okay
You got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might? No way!
Marionette who will clap and obey!
Dude, look... all that noise?
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk... (walk...)
Pay no mind to the new recruit with the Play-Doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid, don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide, don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

We don't need no walkie-talkies
Nope, no walkie-talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no
We don't need no walkie-talkies
Nope, no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be...
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off, otherwise, lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms
It goes, "Hey! Peace! Pray for the plagued!
Major relief and capacious rains."
But just 'cause I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like, "Pardon you!"
Sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No "World's Tiniest Violin Song."
And I might just lie to them all
Lie in the morgue with a deep breath hiding and bored;
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats
And Blockhead got animal drums, like he's Doctor Teeth
It goes red light, green light, one, two, three
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S

I crawled down to the basement when the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up and memories of you
Nineteen sixty-seven, colt forty-five
Holding back the vampires, keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it out by the front door
This is what they make you take the medication for

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than triples
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Asshole...

Asshole... pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
As the misery was dormant and digging in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:
I dig a chick in pig tails, "That's all Folks!"

Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter
Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
X, o, zodiac a pentagram expo
Pet cemetery in electric fresco
Abaddon threshold flesh-forged in the galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like "all signs correlate with sorcery"
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish, cat nap 15
Back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk screen band tees, take apart a vcr, ringer off, canned peas
Cabin fever mi amor
Patiently adhering to the chandelier ta key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes
Echoing a twisted alchemy, freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea scratching "bring that beat back"
I doze off, clothes on, noise in the feedbag
Shhh.. om nom nom, blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones, mangy
Intimately spaced pylons on a plot of inhospitable terrain
Hi mom!


Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis, rain forks into mutton
No abort button, heart pump assorted color sugar water
Poor lummox, unexplained ailments, and doesn't work well with others
Wet nose on the glass, garibaldi half cookie dough, lock jaw
Don 4 walls like a wooden coat, behold the rotting fruit of excommunication
A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases
That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement
Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
Grace of misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream
The ambush predator edition, skill set of Will Tell Aim and speed over short distance
Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat, dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack

Midsummer bit crusher, mid winter bit shifter, no sleep, gold mine, front door circled, proceed, low light, 24 curfews, crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue, proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed himself to artfully carve Zoso in his desk
They was probably thinking fuck you fuck you fuck you in they head
With a hell bound arm and a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And a pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique that technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker, it's strange
A switch he lifted from a siblings skivvy drawer
Who branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharp
To here with a higher purpose
And a prime alert to juvenile beserkers
Like kush Van Morrison an Arcade Drop Floor
Down to the valley time for miss Ahkmar, watch
Capital Z (ed), slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you goes
That levee crushing percussion
Will pull the monkey up right
Twelve or ghetto blaster
Blacken her technicolor telecaster
Lecture at a faster rate
The class was making them develop backwards
It would appear you spelled out all the answers

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust, composed themselves enough to magic-marker "Zulu" on these chucks, they was tryin to do the buckle font from 'renegades of funk', in a 3d frame of exploding brick, and whiz-lines for the locally motion sick, beyond gross but evoked a host of "oh dip" where a social neurosis owned the whole strip, heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth in the marrow of waiting his guardians out, flashlight, chisel tips, milked venom, pistol grip, images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick, silent agreement at hand, king of the hill for a queen of the damned, she in the doorway seething began "that clean white pair had a 3-year planl", oops, capital "zed", radical "u" in the cut, truly to beautiful "l"oser it up, and he done, collateral damage a future alum, that key to Shambala, planet rocking, Bambaatta, sample chop, churning out a cancer for the vandal squad, analog, and he finds, animated colors on a page, like synthesized cultures on a stage

Somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve, composed themselves enough to publicize "the Zeros" in this stall, they was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled, with a festering hate for the gum drop edge, 'disco sucks' tee, punk's not dead, but a transient teen unsung godsend, via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin, cheese, sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority thumbing nose, cutting it's teeth
Pretzled up in special order vinyl, and birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills, 2 dutch at a show in the front, low-key to the can for a smoke and a fuck, Trixie, fixing her lipstick up, when his mitts got bit by the mischief bug, snatchl, capital "zed", terrible "e" in vermillion red, gimme an "0" and a slippery "s", over a web of the shittiest bands, that beat your heart out, never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve, of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns, urgently, offered through the circuits ofan earlier plot, I'll see you at the

When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like, something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like, something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they as how you, living you, tell em you, living like, something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like, something even more important arrived giving, something you should probably try willing

Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridian pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 buses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lilies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade Venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decoupaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

It was less an act of hubris
More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet
Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia
Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer
I crowbar into the pecking order
The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers
Hug a double yellow spine
Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope
Those little fuckers run on passion alone
This is the product of a D.I.Y. inadequate home
Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge
Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome
Traffic amassed against insufferable odds
Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone
I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me
All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling
Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil
P.S. I wrote this on a self destructing memo

Look
Unsigned hype
Front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher
Out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food
Manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, cant lose
Cant gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor
Swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
I mean, I guess it matters to me
I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one

(Check his own) Breakneck pulse
Over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levy made of that tile, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello
Heres where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails
To bootlegs of Hawkwind, saw tooth
Nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card in a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me
Failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette the gods last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous

Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one

Let me put you up on Bob's donuts
Controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras
Mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goat's legs
Will they go for maple, custard, buttermilk or wolfs bane?
Hm, late after your cinderella pulsate and crash I was rotating casts
Picture if you will a witching hour on week night in the trenches
Where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven
With sprinkles
I know right yum
Whether tummy ache or fever
Keep the funnel cake I'm honey glaze in vitro
In the company of similar believers
Sleepless, who hear the walls breath and foam at the facial features
Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated
Equal parts flower, faith, healing
Might replace your previously nominated jesus
But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your god back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light

I boil oil too, not for scarfing
For CCs of japanese innovation that screech into free parking
Purple heart and 2nd chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
You can chew the eucharist in cruller form
Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling where jelly's not a celebrated it's a puppet string
Pluck, nose for canola
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey
Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth
Each progressively more sequestered
Yet if threatened will defend the rasin bread as codefendants
Some lose religion or view it as superstition
You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your god back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light

The fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms
To feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars
And stagger through the pulse of the gulch on a builder's dividends
Hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints
Seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey
I'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
Might, fortune-teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe
Great, grace invaders, the first-name basis patron haters
Who compromise the pilot lights and flavors
Silent night, holy night, invite the pious out the pagan
Midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons
Can I get a fucking amen?
AMEN, hazelnut raiders of the lost, navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross
No name no dayjob
Know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf
Thanks bob

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your god back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light

July 4th, 1981, candles of a Roman ilk
Unloaded from a chevy truck
Into the home her folks had built
Patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs
Safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares
Couple cousins, uncles, aunts, mostly grown-ups, couple brats
Baby Ruby's only two
She's too close to the jumping jacks
Mommy scoops her to the house
Buckles up the booster seat
Rolls her to the storm door
Let her long for all the lunacy
Telephone distracting Mom
Ruby wriggles out her strap
Fingers push the plexi-glass
She's off into the sour patch
Past the pyrotechnics undetected and invisible
Woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool
Off into the yawning blue
The splash would mum the rocket-ships
Ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant
Many sprung and sprinted down
All arrive belated but
The beast she had earlier stirred had been alert since waking up
Canine let his gainer fly
Water top commotion grow
Howling guests assumed the cloven hoofs had come to do-si-do
Frenzied and congested deck
Part to let the elders see
Soggy beagle gently dragging Ruby in his yellow teeth
Laid the tiny body in the sun before her Father's feet
When she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee
Helped the air to reconvene
Towel his shaking Ruby off
EMT confirm the save
Everybody say
"Good dog! "

Birds of a black
Black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
And all of the shit you do
They pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
Little baby bluebird's eyes turn black
Without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
When you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?
Little baby bluebird's eyes turn black

4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
The silouettes are fencing lefty scissors
Separating horn and hoof as own arpeggiators
They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
By the getty image, green-cheese moon
Dead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk!
Shifter shit, brother was a face card
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...
Wait up let me isolate the bass more
Gate of god's acre
Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit
Prisoners, tradition is for lovers
God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some dip or play the dozens
Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records
On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentenceenders
And the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous
Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
Publicly your shadows'll cat call back
Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
Crack the crypt
Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed Iapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
I'll even grit my teeth for you
I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me, I
T's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
Could've used a good lung
Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass
"remember that cow in the dean's seems awkward
And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
Maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines, either way - dope stone lion

And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot
I'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
You can let them let you rot, man
But I'm not going to watch
I'm not gonna stand atop your plot
I love you friend, but I'm just not
On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
I will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
I will climb that tree

Everything you think you're hiding shows
In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
Messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
You don't want the passengers to pass
You want each cow taxidermy'd fatter than the last
Mausoleum lighting is a rush
While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
A proud chest puffed to the heavens
Holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon
And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...

4 and 21 crows
None go south
For the supper when a punk goes out
Checkerboard of mothballed death-forms
Hauled via vaudeville canes
And encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way
Watch, our father
Commuters from the farms with news of el Chupacabra
Who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull
Dumb full blood suckers
Only the chum suffers
Pine box butcher
Encouraging poor lighting
Said a pall bore not a sure sign ofjarred lightning"
Harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born
Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art
Chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders
More for the hive mind
Less for the land mine finders
Fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery
Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee
Straight out the front

4 and 22
Cue the cut throat mouth
Chew together when a punk goes out
Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls
Never run truck jewels
Run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves
In guttural grunts
Smothering buttery lung ramen
Early sign of punk showed up on the diagnostic
Hm, pardon if I seem stand all the see-sawed loss, I can't call it
All petite drawn straws and orange caution
Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement
It's gaudy, plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share an all evolve salty
Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits
Maybe sin ll make for sugar-flavored flesh
Kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw
The rest are recipes
Caw!

There is a bowl cut template mapped with a billy can
Mega morn scissoring a topiary lego man
Mini-ramp cowlick
Good ship snot nose
Lap rain water out of pigeon hill potholes
Rat brain, shovel green peas offa butterknife
Racoon hat, moon boots all summer-type
Felt pressure at the center of the dog show
Better off blending
Sweateroff Waldo you
Wanna see a genome mutate?
Cut a page boy til it bring home a Cube tape
Poof, screw-face wriggle out a chop shop
Home-brewed Kool-aid, d
Isavowing Osh Kosh
Simulating television
Little rowdy rock snob
Bobble-headed shredder playing top-heavy hop scotch
You realize you only got a week
til you catch him with a set of shitty clippers in the sink
Like bzzzzt, motherfucking bzzzzt, bzzzzt
That's a quiet kid, buzzing asymmetric rebel lines in
Crudely, some say to praise the lord
I say you wanna feel saved baby
Shape the orb, and I will see you all in Helven
Read he fled a panic room pissed
And been searching for animal chin since
Bumpin' Johnny Rad, eye on the sauce pan
Current mop: 4 months shy on the off-chance

Start with a text book bowl cut (bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up learn a couple great new curse words (pussy!) buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn
Learn a couple great new curse words (fuckface!) maybe try a ponyhawk, take 2, your turn

I knew this kid Camu
Who in the lion's mouth
Made up a fail safe way to get his life corralled
Let's say he short on the rent
His land lord is upset
He disappears with sheers yelling "I'm going George Jeff"
Bathroom door sound like a partmech barbershop quartet
Forced into war with itself
What emerge next in a shaft of light is bald up top
Long on the back and sides
Maybe the blade oil came with a ax to grind
But granddaddy half-smile, all mastermind
He ask "how do I look?''
I said "you look insane"
He said the haircut come with a theory I'll explain
Please do
First: no hats allowed
Faux nat' male pattern when he out the house
And wouldn't crop it up until his monopoly prop pass go
til then walk this town like an asshole
Motherfucking bzzzt!
Last week we were stoney
This week he program beats all monday
Sold 2 wednesday, pay rent
Fabricate a whole new hedge maze
Back on his smooth shit friday at noon bitch
Wow, just like that
A method I encourage you to share and apply and adapt as one day his didn't grow back

Start with a text book bowl cut (bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up learn a couple great new curse words (pussy!) buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn
Learn a couple great new curse words (fuckface!) maybe try a ponyhawk, take 2, your turn

I wear shoes to bed
Paint teeth on my lips
Trench foot, gangrened for the win
Blitzkrieg bopper
Petitioned out of shit's creek proper
The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler
Screaming uncle in a sea of TV doctors
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing
Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee
More to follow, outside tweakers are in love
Teeny Raquel Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers
Poisoned or maybejust a misfit toy or two
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
That sorta hemming and hawingll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack!

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Sensible sweater on ice
Devil horns high
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
Vendetta-drunk leader squealing
"it's the real pig fever"
Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Custom Troy Hurtubise
Flourish in the blind spot of spittle county gore police
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing war and peace
1 plain brown key foods bag head
2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread
Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
They seem attracted to the matters of the morally snubbed
See my goodnight irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
Whole diner like "I'll have he's having"

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
Truthfully a whole community of scientists are baffled
In '89 maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
Like a half-ton annoyance til the heart-warming story went public
You'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves
A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
Every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic
Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

How to make a homemade mummy:
Get a corpse, get gauze, get comfy
Shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy
For the hallowed excavation of his x-marked tummy
Scalpel to stern, the butter cutter b-lines well
Tongs butterfly the unzipped feline shell
We'll be escorting vital organs
With exception of the precious kittens heart
Into the privacy of separate pickle jars
Or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card
Shit, pick a part and scissor
Stomach, lung, intestine or liver
In a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever
Brain exterminated through the whiskers (kiss & blow)
Ditched, I blank NY alone
We usher in the salts that call the husk home
Might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
Slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons
Like limb by limb, by tail by ear by chin
With the new hereafter I hereby win
I hope you vow to meow another day and never
Decompose, by the way before we seal these molds
The shorten version goes...

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Paper playgrounds, leave your harvest
Take the brain out...

Gadzooks, punk's dead, last good gut wrenched
Antennae sam cook, black book pushead
Cat skulls stacked to the black hole sunset
Olive on a toothpick, Dagwood Bumstead
Tagged-hoof hatchery, matter amass naturally
Bad wolf, dash for the last rook castling
Blue ox, red plaid bass pro flannel king
Hasbro crown, sour apple Abba-Zabba teeth
In poorly taken pictures antiquating on his mantlepiece
Before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines
Folk broke bear claws over gross coffee
Not as milquestoast men, as los muertos walking
Ergo the scarecrow in rare barley
Squared-off harpy to armchair: say a prayer for me
I feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly
I also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Major take down, eat your porridge
Take the brain out, leave the carcass

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Games to reign now, pleased to bargain
Take the brain out, leafed in garlic

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Fading halos, feeding herpes
Take the brain out, eager starlets

Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out, leave the heart in
Take the brain out...

Ian why don't you say grace
"dear god thanks, and if you loved me vegetables would be extinct"
Now I'm looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
Rectangle seat 4, squeeze 5, each one
May not be excused from the table til the green gone
Stomach revvin up an episodic rerun
Where's a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one?
Chris and Graham hate em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp!
Moments later 2 have been released
Leaving me the legroom and the legume police
Going "freeze, you with the pretzeled arms
Send your fabricated nausea my best regards
And know this kitchen as a prison til the pea pods die
I could sit here all night"
So could I

Who was at the doorjust now?
Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides Really?
Yup I told em "oh he busy, he staring at his green beans being a total pussy"

Who was at the doorjust now?
Kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores Really?
Yup, I told em "oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified ofa plant"

Blink Twice if you are being held hostage
I speak and spell ofa sleeper cell in the hospice
Woke, impersonating busy little helpers
That intimately purr between the hiccuping up of feathers
Pick a porcelain dish
A single portion canned
Frozen or fresh
Defies the glory ofthe Poultry or fish
Via communal bloodletting that rupture spud levy
No '87 supper-scape was truly flood-friendly, ever
Including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never
Where room temp heirlooms emanate a crude black mist
To a rendition of "dude, dad's pissed"
Tell dad dude's pissed too
Not to mention genuinely brandishing a the new gill hue
Still out-mule any last strafing watchmen
til the lord taketh waiting as an option

Who was at the doorjust now?

Who was at the doorjust now?
Kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores Really?
Yup, I told em "oh he can't, he in the kitchen pouting and terrified ofa plant"

Less like toes in a tide pool
More like, left, right, poached from notable giant Kaiju
Fat neck, fine tooth, rock and lean, yelling
"this ends now eat the god damn beans!" ah!
Hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that there's flatware exhumed by a crane arm
Time for some action
Stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction
Brined in malpractice
Carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access
If only in compliance with a deep-fried fascist, peep
Literally bite down once
And my tongue get a flooding from my uninvited guts
Pointer finger plug a hole in the damn
Ma notice, "ok gross, dinner's over, go spit", pop call "bullshit"
Both of my brothers break in, like "he's on his Davie Hogan no mistaken", by the way

Who was at the doorjust now?
Kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny-hop the curbsides Really?

If you step on the lawn I keep the foot
Peep, in the pot go 6 degrees of cooked geese
Boiling, blitz the beach of mushed peas
Over 10 meat hooks with a blister each
I'm all pincher, fever-y hoodie on, hoodie off
Sweat thru his E.T. sheets to the worry dolls
Never met a quiet storm that didn't grow into a choir of colliding horns that go click click clack
In territorial syntax
Sitting on the porch with his lids pinned back
Pinball wiz in a thimble of sims
I'm a symbol of whimsy abridged
Kiss me I'm dead, nursing a mystery Dayquil
Led Zep staring daggers down page mill
How pray tell do he sit pretty when the ol' 1 2 unglue in a tizzy
Please hold for the don't play dull boy
Click, I am not a page or a pull toy
Came in the door and the floor is lava
Killjoy if your core more Norman Rockwell
Born home sick for an invisible address
Bat shit, bumble and bat around catnip
One black heart Katamari massive
Packed in a fat category 5 rat nest
Nose on his sleeve, holes in his inner peace
Robot phone like a tentacle of flippancy
Hate you, hate you more, no I hate you infinity
And Pangaea break into smithereens
Interlude prest-o change-o
If it move to quick oh whey oh
Right brain go white train Ramo
Mustache any old Money, "no!"

Merrily merrily merrily merrily
In a cobweb tomb on a hotbed of heresy
Frog men schooled by the god Ed Emberly
Pull dog sleds and exhume Dead Kennedys
Bet, moth into kerosene awful
A caution to straw men lost on vaudeville
A-morally mixing business with 144 dixie whistlers
Lawn chair, strong man twisted whiskers
NASCAR Bic in his missing fingers
Outcast from a system of kiss-the-ring-ers
Are you privy to the misadventures
It's electric, meeting in the middle of the street
With a lethally modified piccolo pete
There is admittedly an incredible mystique
To meddling in the reason a city won't sleep
48 strings of 12
That ring ring ring, whiz bang, jingle bells
And melt bootleg G.I. Joes to black taffy, classic
Fire in the hole backdrafting
Fold wild life out of the wolf pack wrapping
Full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine
TNT plunger in all caps ACME
Blast off half the whole damn mapscreen
No sling no spear
I'm a patchwork of 86'd springs and gears
Who been stung by an un-linked pinky swear
During his what-in-the-fuck-was-I-thinking years
Maybe an awkward phase
Like his acne and sophomore fade
Played, calling all out-of-work action figures
It was death by saturn missiles.

Don't fool with his cool

I turn a staff to a snake and back, evade crack
Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache
Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill
Tabletop frames on dutch tilt, crush kill
MakerBot coin-op arcade punk
Talkin' arcane science, dark age pulp
Four eyes card face, bark Aes iron on
Pork rinds orange age, Jarred brains die alone
No Mulligans, crow bars bird cage
Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day
And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor
Messenger, better get a vessel for a Tetris score
Zilch, cowabunga homies call me "press ignore"
Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil
Farm baited breath and tempermental tremors
That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers
And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
For the footage, I'm off cam dynamite fishin'
For diamondback rattles in his holy grail
Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal
3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock
Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra
Buh-dum-bum, follow the regenerated rebel flesh
Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetra fish
Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
Before we are the severed heads of civil war
And basing radio ricochet off the silver foil
Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil
Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks
I know, this is why we can't have nice things
I prefer to skip the pleasantries
Flip the diner table, dip in time for final jeopardy

No shit
Oh and don't fool with his cool
Ma, can we get a pool?
... Is that a no?

Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces
Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses
Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping
Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping
Slow Mozart, no I've never heard a knocking
Might've burst in on it, splits or skin popping
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lipping grudge or crippling
The wonder twins are bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn't piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, fork hands, google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin' with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him and he dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much but when he do it's beetlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin' the average joe some real estate
Between the big mouth billy bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge
No shit
Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts; Poolside; 0 for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat. "it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half."
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers, " I said "I need to hide a body, " she said "ok honey, talk to you on Friday."
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter. according to the blood-and-water chapter. weird
Who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway? probably some surly dad; only child, 30 cats.
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past.
Except it doesn't always work like that
Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt; where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn;
I told them "you will grow to be something inventive and electric; you are healthy, you are special, you are present." then I let them go

Oh

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pictures; who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material;
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... that's better, here we here we go. disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized, contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! nevermind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? don't play
Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark where the grape vines climb a convenient barn;
I told them "you will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; you are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded." then I let them go

Oh

I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish it's history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels
Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand, where the low tide showcased a promised land.
I told them "you will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; you are patient you are gallant you are festive."
Then I let them go

Oh

(On and on and on and on...)

I spell 666 star 6 9 click
Give his telephone viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook, two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate jelly stone park witcha brie wheel

Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train
Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his ear buds

Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The New Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzi, probably
Bolts on his neck one tubesock wonky

16 panel head mutton chop and ambulax
Double pits to chesty got the espy on a camels back
Handle that huffy wit' a timely parry
And get all up in your kitchen, money, Guy Fieri

There is a wildly elusive moment of bliss
In the spaces between being told you are shit
I would openly suggest identifying the closest
And collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens

Ma'am?

Id like to speak to a supervisor

Back alley brawl over party guests who want a
Steak tartare but we're hardly pet food
Charlie check booth, brody's right
Youre gonna need a bigger boat and a holy dive

Aggravated people driving lemons over limits
With a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics
Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
End up another poached foriegner

Handcuffed down to a toothless tease
Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine
With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter
And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together

Been through the desert on a horse that nameless
Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked
Shores invaded by the new marines
That tear the roof off this mother like Beauford T

Untrained pet with a pen name
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
Step around the rhythm of the red rain
Get away, car horn, stand by, tenth frame

Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty)
Flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey
Package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30
Theres a man with a mask an an app that can dial Fergie

Sir?

I'd like to speak to a supervisor

You want to know why? Because I'm
Dead messengers buried in their Melvin shirts
Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher
Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
Roll with grown men who still use code names
Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails
Might chase six legs through his oatmeal
Oh dear, no pet seat his own homework
Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs
Holmes, sick to the fishbone cone
My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone
It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong
Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws
Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor
Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker
She sells sea shells he, draws revenge
Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

Blip krieg got fat
Rock shot 'till he kiss green time lapse
Block cheddar blitzkrieg climax
Spring clean hijack, bring me my axe

Girl: What are you doing up there?
Guy: Stealing, I'm a weekend burglar
Girl: I'm on my lunch break, you want to help me kill half an hour?
Guy: No..

I'm laying in a cut over stuff from a bad meal
Staring at the sun, on my back like a fat seal
Debating with myself about whether not rap's real
Cause broke motherfuckers are the only ones that have skill
Everybody got intentions that they can't reveal
Major label ax got to act like they don't have deals
Claiming grassroots, I'm like "hell no
Your buzz is as organic as Monsanto."
I'm going at your beanstalk, ax in hand
Over a beat bought Aes Rock, that's my man
People sleeping still believing that we haven't expanded
But that's just a small part of the master plan, bitch
Printnificent, shining 'till your skin chafe
Write until the pen ache, reclining by a big lake
I'm only winning cause I went in an gettin' waked
Chillin' at the crib by the time you get your shit straight

You suppose robots would enjoy listening to music?
You'd think that if robots are electronic creations they
Enjoy listening to electronic music
You think you can create a scientific symphony
We'd not only send to our metal friends but
Would also be fascinating to human ears
You already have the on the other side of the record
I can't wait to hear it

Witty with a drum change queue
Cherries in the mirror of his Mustang too
Took his thang from the South to the rocking Hooters
Bought her wangs and a round, then he chopped and screwed her
Cops say they'd get him so he thumbed his nose up
Petal to the metal, leave them dunked in donuts
Stuck on "so what?" from the aged Tequila
When he drove into the back of an eighteen-wheeler
Basic leader, camp is cardboard
The jet chooses raps to advance their shark soar
Park for my cordial stingers
Address you crossly, corporal clinger
Attention all freaks with newer footing
My radio is not played by Cuba Gooding
Who's assuming that the man's a block boy
Cause he keep his fam happy with lots of Bok Choy

At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Considering a regular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food
There it is
Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

Catch 'em on the lam
(I ain't joking)
No maps, no muster point
(Nah, I ain't joking)
I put a pebble on a tomb
(I ain't joking)
Makin bath tub meth
I'm joking
Here we go

The whip got a tongue and teeth
Too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a Tungston bleep
When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island
Stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science
Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us
Back at the battering ram post-haste
Cro-mags, wait till this Saturday plant grow legs
All you hear is intermittent code names
Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
Unfrozen part of his new J.O
Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao
Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
I was in the dark, dodging and burning

Maybe cause I look like an ugly doll
(I ain't joking)
Pack a wallop in the wheelhouse
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Leave brass tacks everywhere
(I ain't joking)
I own many many homes
I'm joking
Here we go

All hog to we know costume
Black hoodie you can set your watch to
Tall drink, depths like an air raid
Radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain
Down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links
Upperway, upper-case tri-state style kings
Get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves
Lights off, spine on sideways
Riding down the block, scooping Bobby in a boogie-down
Tome told me tell 'em "Hello, 7: 30 noodle-town"
Cool 'em down, global domination over salt bake
Situation commanding a broke dude cosplay
You don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows
The summary is as follows:
"These hate those and this thinks, that's absurd"
Yip yap, y'all cats and birds

Meow meow meow meow meow
(I ain't joking)
Talking rubes on the radio
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Uh, suckers never play me
(I ain't joking)
I found Jimmy Hoffa's body
I'm joking
Here we go

The first step is a doozy, it's roulette with a mood ring
The birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak
A permanent post-game, a spitter with bridge trolls
Skirting the copay, divvy the death toll
Maneuverable codenames, alerted and mobile
Familiar rising, and furnacing cold piles
Resilient style kings, impossibly tantrum
Wandering wild things, obelisk phantoms
On linoleum or lava, leaders of a leadfoot fauna
His left source blunt force trauma
Not pillar of the commune, a splinter off the pagan
Who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation
From the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids
By the beautiful and cryogenic stasis
Sadists, meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot
Committed to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock
Are shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially
Homie, no myth flowers grow where he piss
And I still row boats outta bottles without abandon
To shrink into the sunset bumping Pachelbel's Canon
In D motherfucker, the author of the artistry
May or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy

Hello. Hello? Shit

Too geeked up to even keep it down
Too peaced out to even be around
Too beat up to even breathe it out
(Too freaked out to even leave your house)

You wish you could dance more, I wish you would talk less
My gentleman transformed, to bringers of offed heads
Moments of land war, my Lazarus species
Tattered and bruised up, from back in the cheap seats
Hackers on crew cuts, foam at the mush mouth
Gag at the news truck, notably unsound
Dragging his clown shoes, food on his moustache
Raggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass
I'm good, house at the beach of expelled hubcaps
Black lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft
Bad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper
Of kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas
And underdogs with posters of a front-side Tony Alva
On the sticker laden walls above their uncle's Bowie albums
Graduate to flyers of an execrated sigil
And live to see another sexy generation fizzle
Out, keep rap homely
Bear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee
Fat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow's feet
Rat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, goatee
I walk with Hawaii on the greenscreen behind me
So even the awkward pauses feel inviting
Standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out
Can't talk now too freaked out

Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
4 corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail
Losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin wake in the night
Make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry
Dude... seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end, if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sarah gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"

(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm off the grid
I'm through the gate
I fly these kites into the fray
(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm out the box
I'm through the mud
I fly these kites into the cut

NorCal fried bacteria
No ID survive the vivarium
Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin
Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim
Might hold court with the cats and dogs
Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw
In terry cloth robes outside detox surly
Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throws of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds
A deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack
I'm ships in the night
I'm darts at a map
Word up

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I "used" to draw
Portraiture in a human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn, it was soothing
Moving his arm in a fusion of man made tools
And a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No-name nuisance
Stools in a bedroom
Oozed in a brand new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grey scale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross-contour, little bit of back light
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can imagine a rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two bedroom doing menial jobs
Plus, rhyming and stealing and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty year affinity and rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's...

Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were
Colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

Used to paint
Hard to admit that I "used" to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
A miss and a push and a pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids intermittent
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And I grew up in a linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice in the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inwards
Zinc-white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studios drone with allusions of tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
Of proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
Then the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards in unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up at the sky, it's...

Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were
Colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding
Where is the truth you promised?!

The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks
I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy F's chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No
Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s
I was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades

Lotta years
Naw mean? Lotta years

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one seperately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest
A measure of what the spectrum involves

Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark

Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a jobby was a miniature Hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama, black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm often coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means

Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

Hey warm cider, barn full of spiders
Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface
True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Under a sideways rain cornering the briar
Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Talking Master P, memory foam everything
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Spinal Tap 11, tapping resin out the evergreen
Designated dark horse, headless independently
Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs
Buried bones, and his very own blurry sasquatch vids
Led like field ants to a hot lens
8 o'clock kittens vs cobwebs, fight!

Maps won't work here

Ice over bittersweet nightshade
Antlers rise from his migraine
Shred or die, life's strange
How do you identify?
New with the matutinal or peckish with the vespertine
Me, I'm pretty useless
Til the roof is painted Gemini, then set him free
Eat his own body weight in genocide
Came back a decorated dog of war
Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door
Additionally, dog isn't even his final form
Just a period, between greenhorn and Hyperion
Peer into the eye of a primordial experience
Portamento warriors in unforgiving wilderness
Borderline ethereal, Noah's Arc room tone
Add a little up high down low too slow
Found acquaintances a pain to babysit
So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip
Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows
Fish float belly up songbirds crash into windows
Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap
Suicide flies take dips in the kill zone
Still shuffle thru a stack of old photos
Taken before the varicose verified Chronos
I dunno it feels weird
I'd rather feed an apple to a deer

I might've heard something in the walls
Could've been voices
Could've been claws
Coulda been the rebel yell of something more evolved
Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like
"Wadup"

Ain't shit

Die already
None defy the one-man walled city
Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell
Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Necktie on his head, condor on his arm
Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable
Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult
Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling
Either way his ID show a snake and skull
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl
Soon enough I will estrange you all
I get ghost

(Now the free throw!)

On Dasher
Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar
Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and
Carnivourous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms
I dunno I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents
Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist
Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy
Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate
Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway
Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones
Just know when the room go cold
I'm a ghost

G-H-O-S-T
Ghost ghost ghost
He's ghost

Flea comb, exorcism and de-worming
Fitted for a curse and a crown of birds circling
Search party falling forward unthwarted
Meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered
For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards
Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper
And a runneth over cup full of black tap water
Its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter
Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast
And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes
With no immediately measurable crimewave ice-age
Christ children still skin a cat sideways
I don't pick teams or administer bans
I'm in the creek with a pick and a pan, it go
Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene
Tell 'em what the out-of-order blinking EMF mean
Ghost

Yup
Steps up to the plate
Little brother, little league
'87 he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger
Newly out of tee-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Churched then a grump alones runner third first
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", nose in her word search
See MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher, and are advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi Peggy"
I was 10, chewing on a sweet tart
Little brother, left-field, Queen's guard
Mean arm, knees bent
2-out, 2 on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up
Tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!"
Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left-fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders at a supple
No baseball in the bubble
Ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable
The players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close
Head coach not amused
Coach seeing red
Coach on the diamond dragging 27 inches of aluminium behind him
When he transverse 3rd, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of man vs vermin
Here we go
Man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live whack-a-mole
In a scene that would try every child as adult
Woah
Pallbearer with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence
Coach at the bench
Both teams lose
"Good game. Good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", Cubs ain't playing

My little brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
My other brother pretty funny too
Ain't seen him in a minute though

Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers
Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers

Yup
Not a part of the machine
Big brother, big idea, 9-0, 16
Neubaten tee, plaid flannel laden adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend
Peel sessions in a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your Mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the village voice
Checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was Christ has risen to Chris
3 loves, 2 fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch
Coming to a theatre he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Copped tickets, ha the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Moms still worrying
"Why are they called Ministry? Are they a cult?"
Maybe she could probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all, no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he'd loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high-arts
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count no concert and Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched converse

My older brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
We hadn't spoken in a couple moons
I called him last night
"How you doing?"

Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers
Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers
Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers

I see how y'all be trying to front, man y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking some day someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect
And I just couldn't fathom
Blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nahmean?
When you wake up 8 years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh shazbat
Not the "ever after" he wanted from the "once upon a time"
Dot, dot, dot
Once upon a time he was so much more than a punchline for his own potshots
Ah, Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl
I was poison, heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
A go dark in the face of the fucked, when the fucked was a friend I was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk
And I can't
Here go the hindsight
8 years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred cuz he never really healed from the first
Oh what a world
Any hack is a myth, any dap is a joke
Any map is a trick, any graph is a hoax
Ease on down, I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle
That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are
And still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nill
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, Aes

My first name is a random set of numbers and letters and other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a sussurus, couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo
My address, a made up language written out in living glyphs lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the Ouija, then checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku
My age is obscure
My 'in-case-of-emergency' is in the daisies chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores, and people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service still
I'm burger meat and purple pills, "here"
"Thank you. We'll call your name."
Sure you will
Skipped lunch
I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias
Sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of Arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In Purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human combing over Home and Garden stoned
Gold chains over turtlenecks, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrap around a wounded animal
Womb with the Schubert he's a future human-cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco
Let's get to the seppuku, uh-oh
That pretty penny turn the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings, then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunch the budget up and punch the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven
The fuck?
I'm shrunk

She says, "I'm not your enemy"
I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say"
Instead of playing off the chemistry she said, "You're being difficult"
I said, "I'm being guarded. You're a quarter mil in debt, I get more guidance from my barber
Look, I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie fest
You built your walls up high or say goodbye to all your Cookie Puss
Here's one, every time my telephone buzzes I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds."
She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic, it's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic."
I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic, I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation, okay?
Agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans
Honoring the push and pull I should have called the Scholomance
Oh well. Preservation is a doozy
"Will you be needing another appointment?"
"Absolutely"
I'm shrunk

Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome
Hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot, she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swap 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found god in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship, it's an MD recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors

Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
What you doing there
(I'm not taking my)
Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
Why'd you eat that leaf

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game-face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
15 years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "Ionno, maybe get a kitten"

Hey Kirby
What you doing Kirby
What you doing there

Dum-diggy, bump Biggie
Til the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie"
The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants
War paint, circling a duralog
Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog
Schlock purist, watch the block burneth
One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins
The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis
Doggie bag doctors, military deserters
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not
Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs
Might pedal by the police
Tuff with two F's

Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
The coke bottles tint film noir
Tripping out the milk bar
Poison horchata cup
Milf in the Zip Car
6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw
Part Def Jam part Dischord
My wig-picker threw me out of her office
Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome
Onion of 'bensis
Summer was awesome
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in the cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Cholera in the well
Make money periodically vomiting on himself
I read Nat Geo, craft and crack geodes
Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain
Tuff with 2 F's

TUFF
TUFF

(What's so funny?
You, what are you laughing at?
I said what are you laughing at?)

Before a player ever met his omega
They were effectively reducing his behavior into data
With plans to build a dais where the
People grow potatoes and cabbage
Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas
In a spectacle displaying the nature of strange neighbors
I paint caves 'til the rage campaign tapers
And show a new crop how he used to moonwalk
Out of breath like a 7-day old balloon dog
I still hang band posters and buy black-lights
Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis
Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe
Nevermind the Ford-era christening and pants size
Man, who could've guessed the future of abominable imagery
Would also share a birthday with Kenny G? None
The 99 cent 2 cents keeps 2 arms folded
Tuff with 2 F's

Yeah, let's do it like that

Unh I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers
And convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures
The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard
For the gone like Gossamer under number 3 clippers
Free, forged in various pulp channels
Even his prize horse rides a wolf into battle
Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up
Or his name off the paper
It's Aes pronounced "Why Us?!"
First learned the high art of eyeing a mark
Buying nickels for a dime at the park
I learn to rhyme in New York
I learned to breathe underwater
I learned to walk with a ghost
Adidas reeking of sulfur
A chauffeur cemetery funk
When home is a bleeding ulcer
Everything you ever stood up for is keeling over
Moonset beautifying
Cartoon death catfish on the Foreman
Tuff with 2 F's
Yeah

My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevensies to megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
Ass ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOPs
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mullin' over Chuck D, telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the SuperCuts supin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face-fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for ya
Whatever that means for ya
Whatever that
Ah (Fresh)

Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die
Started eatin' kale and came to terms with my lazy eye
Puttin' on the yoga lady, cuttin' off the cable guy
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
Mentholated tiger balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons in the niacin, iron choir riot masked
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing with a sing-a-long of stexicism ever
In the end, gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wish there was a theist
The type that fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...

Act natural, whatever that means for ya
Whatever that
(Fresh)

Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
From diary of the dark to piety in the ponzi
On my better days and then mingle and walk off into the poppy
On my worst, work is overshadowed by the monty
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
The piss poor vision is forty percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
Would weaponize the information before we could send roses
And they want a little pearl in how he got to where we at
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat

Oh and act natural, whatever that means for ya
Whatever that means for ya
Whatever that means for ya
(Fresh)

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo-woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a 'capital-T terrible' two days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh
Wolves are in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining
Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or ten
Maybe we deserve a day of rest
Not to mention...

Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat
Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades
I said, "I'll take first watch"
One AM defend the whole block

The coyote, summon the ghosts of blown diodes
Open to moving like a luchador with no eyeholes
Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft
Christ pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps
Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch
Tell him, "Maybe less badminton, more Scrabble Dash"
"Less Jarts more Rummikub," whatever
Keep the scallywag wrapped up in the subterfuge
Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued 'til he dapped his mans up at departures
I could drive into a lake of fire
Pay the piper COD
Aware the pot and kettle shop, a little toxin equally, at least
It's probably more the kid than the kid
Either way a vital widget in the system is sick
A sea of symptoms in the hinges, hit the room all at once
All I could do was plug the roof with my gum
For now I gotta...

Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass
Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash"
I said, "I'll take first watch"
One AM defend the whole block

So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex
Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus
Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes
No compost, bird seed out of feeders
Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether
Keep a hand on the pepper spray
Sneakers on the detour
They're more scared of you, than you them
Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has two chins
Leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills
Guilty innuendo romanticizing the potter's field
Not sorry, but I never really was a leader
Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza
You meet a few exceedingly forsaken
Sit around the cooler refusing domestication
A couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running one AM
By the way...

A third party, who was incidentally not Alex
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots
I said, "I'll take first watch"
One AM defend the whole block

Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Dinner's in a black earth gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a seven year cherub in the backyard
Epitaph and all
Disciple o' the cycles and sciences of birth in a fertilized hyacinth
Life in the vitamins invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie in the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig
The nuances of putrefying jelly
Hit the levee when those feathers are a cancer in your besty
And I pick a ginger gold that's fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that sumner blood work
Remember them ascending settling any high scores
Forty meters up with the heart of a high dive horse

Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Impossible, impossible

(Hold the fuck up
Who is you talking to?
Cause ain't nobody talking to you
You can't do a motherfucking thing)

I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon
Ripped the phone up out the wall
The 'Po would drag me from my bedroom
An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
And the kinda doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum"
While explaining why you're selfish to romanticize a ruse
And watch unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose
Any urge isn't discernible from community service to the kiddo
Plus she'd make a beautiful widow
But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the eighties
When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
But he didn't, it wasn't cause he doesn't get the message
More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is
On a scale you made up anyway
Half past out to pasture
Whether clapped or batteries in backwards

Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Impossible, impossible

(Check this shit out here
Don't be trying to come all for me
Cause you is not all of that with your fucked up haircut)

I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit
Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed
An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
Or theist, we certainly become the Earth as equals in a circle
Unique until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor forcing whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
Social code broken, a hierarchy to gasp at
Black labs over wack dads on the admat
Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms
I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix
Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff
Somewhere in between the dust and dust

Paint "No Rules" on the water tower
Impossible, impossible

Spoilers
The non bon-voyage stock weaponry and soylents
And whatever stop the voices
Colossal paranoias out to author an abrasive lore
About how war paint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby
No ground wires, all jaw froth
Mouth-breathing outliers climb out of mothballs
Wrung stones unsung and alone
Known to run up in the unknown "honey I'm home"
I push a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake
I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake
Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away
Til then he's documenting cops and watching Heaven decay
It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation braced accordingly
Who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
Yes y'all the crestfallen careworn
Air horn, air horn, air horn, air horn

These awful winds
Those grinding gears
This pile o' bones
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These violent drums
Those primal fears
This pool of mud
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

That's impossible, body's still warm
Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
I'm catatonic, fat, and outta rocket fuel and ramen
Not a dollar, watching Rocky II in Donatello boxers
At some hot as hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri-La
More akin of angry mobs with anchor tats and mangy dogs in vacant lots
Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
Not even a baby doll to change his gauze
Not even a hide-away to hide up in
A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again
Departures and arrivals aren't only time in mileage
Try again again a raider break off from the phalanx
And never look back never cook crack K thanks bye
New York in the rear view then peel...
Out, til he found New York in the windshield

These cursed dogs
Those flying spears
This rancid food
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These fleeting hopes
Those vital prayers
This bag of cash
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w-wild frontier

This was never an effective way to rally insurgents
Or really even the occupation of a rational person
When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in
You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement
In a jiffy, just eat your food and keep the future iffy
That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity
Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection
God forbid he try to live or gain momentum
Mend or pay his penance
You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps
Surf a thousand couches
Take a jagged little down the hatch
Chowder heads
I know you love the way the failure flounder
Maybe I could be your daily downer
If his brain left his body and was headed for the door
Would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar?
No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze
We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades

These churning seas
Those quiet sneers
This box of parts
That's why I'm here
Wild frontier
(Come on)

These creepy friends
Those dicey dares
This perfect dark
That's why I'm here
W-w-w-w wild frontier

The dirty dishes are becoming self-aware
Even the roaches like "I wouldn't raise my children here"
Simple syrup in his veins, dirty nails, lizard brain
Eyes wide, spine like a saltlick a pissing rain (pssss)
ASR Schroder split the rent with ghosts and bacterial cultures
Might track poltergeists prints through his Folgers (gross)
Home is where the unholy sojourn
Dead sea bath tub
Never mind his welfare
Party at the penthouse; carpeted in pet hair
Fridge full of black deli meat and dead air
Sill prefer it to the overbearing lens flair
And death stare at Plinko and an at risk ego
System, egos over peace, love and wisdom
Police shooting everything
Media's a fuck show
Religion is a scapegoat for cut-throats
Fuck no

I ain't going out there, man
I don't trust no one out there, man
You don't even know what's out there, man
Man

Sick of fancies on the prowl
So I don't need to do laundry
I'll dry myself in paper towels
Can't have a decent conversation with the butcher, baker or candlestick maker
At least they smoking vapor now
Still a lot going vacate and ain't breaking out
It's such a boring scene
I found my buoyancy in quarantine
Accommodations second rate
At least it's an environment that I can regulate
Like I was Warren G
I got a phantom pocket full of ice cubes
Fuck what's popping on the street
I gotta sweep up mice poo
I waged a war against the spiders and what's left of them mosquitoes
But these blood suckers leave a bump
Those blood suckers always want to free-load
Yo, who's that peeking in my key hole trying to keep it on the d-low
Playing simple minds, my favorite simple minds
So I'm closing all the windows and I'm shutting all the blinds

I ain't goin' out there, son
I don't trust no one out there, son
I don't even know what's out there, son
Son

Yo, I got a big-ass TV and my house has four of 'em
Some of y'all is cutting the cords or mad more of 'em
Fuck foraging, I do the shit that I can sit and do
Maybe in the future we can fly by a living room
Or order from Grub Hub but it ain't no pasta left
Outside is where my distant cousins get shot to death
Plus I'm very broke, I ain't even got a buck for the ferry boat
If something dope happens throw it on periscope
A meerkat? Seen it. I ain't trying to hear that
I'm planted in my zone because home is where it's weird at
Anything I want I locate with little to no wait
Through a vast network of homies that work for post-rates
Hella spies still sitting here, so watch me rotate
Outsiders for the prize says "sugar in traffic jams"
Device charged, apps in hand, I'm a handy-man
If you want to give me some energy come and visit me

Because I ain't goin' out there, fam
I don't trust no one out there, fam
I don't even know what's out there, fam
Damn

My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz
I was born in 1-9-7-6, at Biosfet hospital, located in Long Island, NY
I am 6 foot, for I weigh 2-0-0 pounds
I have brown hair and green eyes
I enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food
I have two brothers, Chris and Graham
and two parents, Paul and Jameija
In august of 2-0-0-1 I went crazy..

This was originally not for public consumption
This was made for four people... four people that literally saved my life
They know who they are..
And ahhh I mean I could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them
I don't think this song would pay for them
But hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further..

This ain't a burner for the whips (no it isn't)
This ain't even Aesop Rock fly earthworm demeanor (no it isn't)
My name is Ian Mathias Bavitz and I was born in Long Island, New York
Seventy Six, before Graham and after Chris... OK
In August of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone, scaffling imploded
I kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling
to the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips
for ciggaretes and soda, shook me to kasper
Dizzy with a nothern chaser, motor sensory eraser
Gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangements
Rose rapidly outta fog I'd never fished in
that abates three separate foreign men's
While I seems to hook lines and syncro simple fishing
Simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body
but the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi
So now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mol edge
Shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence
And, I'd be lying if I said all of this
made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
That's frail... Simply put
I don't know what happened, or what's stillhappening
I literally feel like I'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
JAMIE, I killed the robots and I'm sorry
Broke down in front of you, embarrassed
but you lent a heart and hand that only you could
you're one of my best friends and yes I'd take that bullet for you
That's my word, which is about all I have left
TONY, I know you know you crazy, 'cause you told me
but that did never bother you, I hold you as my brother 'til death
And I got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
for makin' a cat laugh, when I was walking with the dead
KATHERINE, mother figure, older sister, concerned be a limits
Letting me know I wasn't the only one with this
Continuous offers for vacation, Chicago visits
Talked me to repair of a head full of broken pistons
RIYAH, for the late night movie rentals and the company I needed
An' you knew it, but I just wouldn't admit it
You listened to me brag about my issues for hours
Offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when I was finished
Am I a jack of all trades? Nope... I like to write songs tho'
Are they good? I dunno..
But I could tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it
So take this how you want, but know I mean it
I want you all to know that I'm scared
Now my fuckin' crooked soul never faced a monster like the last few months
Never in my whole life... I wish I could explain this better (I can't)
But the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
So I guess this is my feeble way to thank you
Four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
I owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
'Cause without y'all I may not have a life to offer, take it

Thank you
I wish I could explain this better. (Thank you)
I'm sorry for burdening your pleasures. (Thank you)
I love you all with all that's left of me. (Thank you)
For helping try to kill what made a mess of me. (Thank you)
Somehow, someway. (Thank you)
I'ma get you back someday. (Thank you)
Just gotta figure this all out... So..

I guess it is kind of funny when you look headed from a step back
How one man can literally buckle under the same pressures
Other men operate normally under
I have soaked this out from all angles, walking through time
I have been over everything in my head, still I can't think anymore
But I guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there
to breathe for you
I am lucky enough to have those people around me
Thank you for helping me to not die
Thank you for helping me to not die

Pocket full of pennies, and a soul gone tilt
Cockpit full of memories and a dream full of guilt

This be the dawning of the age of dead water
Stitchin every b-boy fragment
Somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up
This is a right now generation murdered by the fan base
This is adored by the writers-Dead water
With a still force activated
No I'm not feelin alright

Formed by the village of badness and bad karma
Punched by the stagnant water gate threw the fickle back
But by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank
Caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains
Flashed automatic b-boy with big visions
In a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship
Who better nation a million's the only remedy
Nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece
Take Me Through The Gates
I'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
Con artist kamikaze conduct
Warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster
I recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger
As opposed to the skip of big brother bad slapper
Theologies who need to keep the cookies caffeinated
like a mad hatter that'll sleep now, ask after
Calibrate the happy scale when he's soakin
wet with a mouthful of dead ideas and see if it tipped zero
Stripped ego, tall stories of broad glory
I'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40
Or maybe I'll be gramacin, homes poor, broke and lonely
Hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity
I drink a bad glass of gumption
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning disgusting
Wildchild activater activate sludge enough to dungeon for a accolade and wild ones
I committed wild murder, went through the city
with a wild merger, woke up in a wildstyle burner
Space case, boom box, hate tapes, no lemonade breaks (sweat), no cheddar in labor days
Right now, I'm here to break a point of big system plus my screen
I was never cursed in a russmeyer bixon
Spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
Of the dirty basement at the graves of Salem witches
Driving my stake through the face of painstaking business (checkmate)
But I scream Misery (better breath take)
Out of sleep, lifted up lobotomy, little Jackie paper
and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
I'll be the ugliest version of paranoia
kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure
Some get excited when the sun folds under
Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
Some get excited when the bullet hits bone and a board
I'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken

This be the settling of debt of warm water
A mobile b-boy function
Somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up
This is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial
This is the heater to a movement-dead water
When I broke fifth and got sparks
No I'm not feelin alright

This be the windshear dodgin dead water
Solitary b-boy wonder
Somebody fresh enough to reinvent the court with a fist up
This is the funky outline around a classic breakbeat
This is an agitated moment-dead water
With a burnt future, beaten, ugly
No I'm not feelin' alright

"Do you know what 'nemesis' means?
A righteous infliction of retribution
Manifested by an appropriate agent....
Personified in this case by me"

We're all in the same gang, bread and butter
Just a couple subdivisions who naturally hate each other
Influences shark biting the fuck outta your brother
Friendship is Professor Plum ratting on Colonel Mustard
You are now witnessing the world's most craft version
Of a barnstormer, reveal time with a jagged edge
Arm mortars and ?free minds? for a bastard sledge
On the style diamond cutter
Swung before that magnificent havok sketch
You fidget like a nervous culprit gulping
Sweat a bullet, dead a bullshit sequence reactor
Speaking disaster
Who leaped off the canvas to provoke a ?style miner?
Fake as the grass with a sturdy belly and his work to sell me
I got my word to tell you
I got absurd magic
For the forks like pistons pumping through the realm my family habits
(Madder or Rabbit Hat combination)
Nah, more like I'm spitting pixleak dust
Till the mixed vapor community combusts

I hold words for ransom
Demand some attention pays
Not to mention praise for their release on a page
It might amaze the light of day
I never said I, gave, them all, the fight to be brave
More insight to behave
Raw like them others
Whose ads have been paid for by some brothers
While some of us lie in the eyes of others
I discovered another way to stay undercover
Kill everyone involved, Unsolve
Mysteries, this to me is how to leave matters resolved
Out of this all, you should take a break, ask the fake
Get snatched out your habitat and left on the side of alake
I try to debate
Whether a clean getaway is harder to make
Than a call to the cleaners
Dropped off a seamless bag
Zipped it up with enough cash to pay the cat
With the aqua demeanor

God is a name I call myself
I don't like Ugly, Original, Synthetic
I breathe rusty air logic
It becomes the lung, the mind is a closet
That is if it's a walk-in, cuz I'm open
You fell from the clips of weakness, I scoped it
I'll ball your rhyme up and stuff it inside my mouth
As if this was the first grade...(C'mon man)
And you'll just stand there
Your eyes'll water up
And your teeth'll grind cuz you rhyme first grade
Seeing me is like time, I'm a caged poet
But I think life is more than a jail sentence
That's why I, took my time
Doing calisthenics which euphemisms to hand out a life sentence
When I rhyme, I put my ass crack in it
And you in a glass bottom boat with a crack in it
So fuck your attitude
My poetry's position is the sole definition of latitude

"Sinister"

"You tell the angels in heaven you've never seen
An evil so singular personified as you being hit
In the face by the man who killed you"

Oh my God
They've got angels sweatin' like Hell, it's
workin' their little halos to the bone combing them deserts
my figure eight knotted
lifeline defined traffic
the way my schoolin' end-less-ly defined every day
one exquisite fitted crisis rivets an octagon of red
to the ceiling above my bed
it's not a conversation piece, like public spectacles
unleashed more of a clue
so when I wake up to the rains I'll be one step ahead of you
I slide like Kodakrome
wrote a poem for every planet
tracked their mileage from the sun in an envelope
licked it, stamped it
got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left
only the earth would thank me later with a breath taking sunset
(man, I'm just a bum)
zip that waterfall around your skeleton
tell it to boil
loyalties, the shovel in the soil
dig it, I split my lip kissing the winter
nursed the blister in the sun
strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood
might of worked
sip a little, litter it, love it
without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket
might of, tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes
without hot air balloons floatin' their four passenger baskets
and I'm asking you
to let a captive lacerate a caption
splash out massive
apolster plastic glasses with famine patches
i-dentify all saints linked around the fountain's warmth
and for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns
born hostile, pacifist huddled in subtle masochist
stamp the blame on
my fire escape overlooks ghost town market place
artists bought out passes
then fast themselves to the target's face
you're killin' me

if I had a hammer, I'd build a city on stilts
so my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts

if I had a shovel, I'd dig a hole in the dirt
and I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth

and if your little wing is broken
I'll see the poacher in hell
I can't afford another in a cell
my carousel mimics the interests of a thousand leaking spickets
and a colony of graziers raised to justify the grimace
(and yes I read the treaty)
I prescribe the remedy plus the premises
my pin cushion, my limbs pushin' the knitting needle
evils, idle, peddle past the greeting
where the sleepers feed the cycles
stop, watch the eagles board the little engine that could not
ghost in a shell
and it fell in my lap
passin', postin' the bail but the guard has misplaced the key ring (that's wonderful)
I lead a flee to blaze exact songs directly into the village
power supply burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye
now how many cadavers satisfy a mad man?
and how many crooked samaritans turn plesantville to bad land?
I can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing
about you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings
(well, you're right)
grip your pointed stick, incite your riot
I'll sell your worth in a bottle at profit, explain my bias
atomic box cult, downward spiral rapidly
cast to hell with hate mail, forged Christ's autograph
laughed itself, drastic catastrophe
biting my lip
skin and bones, stringent
bingin' on rancid baits
mummified well inside a muddy New York minute was it
your remnants my smoke rings have cocooned prior to fading?
well, it wasn't conscious spite but it might have been that

I am not your friend anymore
my arrow head dissertation
when narrow bed sleepers occupy the basement
and I am not your friend anymore
come the dawning of in your pity blend that whispers in the wind

man, if it were only that simple
I'd add a guilt frame to
I'd board myself inside my room to trace the wilting contour
one petal falls to the rug, she loves me not
town crier lugging a boom box with spirit plugs
and a red radio flyer
tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailors knot
fiddler crabs build sandcastles while high tide off azalea crops
in the icicle field I portray, cats get antsy
and ask 'why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?'

why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?

why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?

why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?
well if it ain't finally a question that's worth answering

I boogie for the raindrops
for the purity, the anger
for my childhood recollections
for the comic book in my heart
the mocked intentions
the clarity, passion, seclusion
those cool summer nights
for the mark emerging across the street selling me stog's at half price
for the mights, the maybes, the nauseating pitfall
my girl, my friends
for the fact my window opens towards a brick wall
for the three legged dog I saw dragged on a leash
for the homeless man who walks my block in rainstorms with plastic bags on his feet
see I throw away the tenders over one shoulder
and walk across broken glass
through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning
not for nothing
you'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals
whispering 'maybe Aesop Rock was on to something'

maybe, no promises

Impossible Kid, 4/29
Just some shit

Three's company, Appetite for Destruction tee
Chunky Monkey, Funyuns, I can feel the cat judging me
Please, I've seen you eat your puke and drink the toilet water
Which completely renders your opinion void, you little fucker
Poison puffers hit the reef, hissing through their missing teeth
Pissy like a Minotaur with six hours in the middle seat
Or middle schoolers protesting the mystery meat and Catcher ban
Castaways walk into the same light as Carol Ann
Dagger in his teeth and treat a rapper like a rack of lamb
His allergy is middling, his middle finger's Plastic Man
Dag, they want a de-radicalized youth
Though it sort of undermines the magic of high noon
My right hand writing a diary of the dodgy
I do the wrong thing when all the right people are watching
It's a medley of defiance and outfoxing
Born in a storm's eye alongside Long Island swamp kings
Bonk, shoegaze rap, get your blue suede
Get used to the goofy get-a-clue face
Jump into the goon goose chase, try the Kool-Aid
Try the blue plate, it tastes like doomsday
Off leash gryphons at the Westminster Kennel Club
As vessels of Beelzebub, bite the hand that belly-rub
Lug it to the belfry, keep the pups alive and healthy
We as hunters treat the summers like a mother ripe for milking
Up and feeding Alexander Pardee art into the silk-screen
Still here, sleeping with the lights on and quill near
Tour van, corpse paint, war moon
Make the bass wobble like a two-man horse suit
Dork-proof, type to forge a sword in his dorm room
Break fiends, drain 3's from the warp tube
Long tooth, short fuse, Stormtroopers over John Zorn loops
If you ain't core, it ain't for you
Trolls, bubbling from the lows
Want nothing but to run him for the bulk of what he owns
Homie, all of this material ain't shit to me
The trinketry, the filigree, the antiquated theories of validity
I never really cared for the cars
The point A to B sound scared when it starts
Trash can fire in the middle of the crib
Where the coven swap recipes and riddles from the crypt
It's monsoon season, keep the log flumes leaning
Religious paranoia get the Doc Seuss treatment
Breaking out the Bronx Zoo, tabletop the Mongoose
Gray fade, ain't afraid to knock a few cogs loose
I'm from where it's defense on three
And anybody with a fucking brain bump Sean P
Old boy, might combine the carve with the stalefish
All aboard the mid-life snail's pace tailspin
You were busy authoring the holy grail of mailed-in
I was busy snow, sleet, heavy rain, hail, wind
Ready, aim, fail shit, it's Hail Marys everywhere
Over all the petty shit, under all the messy hair
I'm Untouchable, uncrushable plus I'll
We don't need another hero, we just want our cups filled
I'm Trivial Pursuit cards at the 40/40 buzzkill
Aesop Rock, code name: Yo, son, chill

The water ain't safe, the land's made of mortar
I hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to corner
I'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer
But I rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster
Can a run-away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter
To force the brutal truth of daily marketplace wars through the roof?
I mean, I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning
And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling
But I'm sick I've plowed these fields a thousand times over
Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quarters
And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea
I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally
Take a number, the apple seeds raineth upon your slumber
A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
My every whim acted upon has gone loopy
But I play a game called let's prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings
I split the radius of go-getter bellies, reconnaissance
Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze
Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease
Tummy full of sand running man impossible stop
There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust
Surfing the urban Ididaride, certainly flushed
Now one in the hands work to and top the toilet seater
But what lies inside my heart is off the motherfucking meter

See the Water ain't safe no more
"I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn"
See the water ain't safe no more
"Nah nah the water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across
"The water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane can offer
"I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile"
The Water ain't safe no more..

And I've always been a 40 night chronologic hostage
Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch
Wingless Anime
I don't play in the man race cycle
Hope floater
Gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops a slot
And potent quotas
I'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways
Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless
Now tip-toe across a lost cause
Because a lost cause found
Don't mean you found a cause
That means you found a lost cause
Ok now I've been here for role playing
Slaying my here and now
To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow
And it's incredible
Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels
But bad apples ain't sweet
And cretins acts ain't that memorable
I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide
Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine
I wear a tiger striped ego and bilbo act my progression
Where the kindlings formulated through the flesh of the oppressors
Now, God had a flask I can prove it
You really think the 13 loops that used honor
Spawned me a sober unit? check potion
Addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler
Adhered to the back bone, stone pusher
Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement
That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison
It's beautiful, truly beautiful
I keep a stick inside my hand
And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram

See the Water ain't safe no more
"I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn"
See the water ain't safe no more
"Nah nah the water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across
"The water ain't safe no more"
I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane can offer
"I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile"
The Water ain't safe no more...
