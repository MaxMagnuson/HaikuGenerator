\section{Introduction}
Give a quick overview of what we did for our project.

\section{Haiku introduction?}
Explain what a Haiku is and and give an example of one? This and the next section can probably be combined.

\section{Haiku Constraints}
Demonstrate how a haiku can be represented as a constraint problem. For example explain how each word can be represented as a node and a link of nodes with the right number of syllables is a line and three lines makes a haiku.

\section{The Search Space}
Explain the basic concept of a markov chain and illustrate how we used it as our search space. Secondly describe how we parsed files in order to create this chain from lists of sentences/words.

\section{Search Algorithms}
Go over each search algorithm we implemented in detail.
\subsection{Naive Search}

\subsection{Short Random Walk}

\subsection{Depth First Search with Backtracking}

\section{Results}
Give some examples of the haiku's we were able to identify and acknowledge some of the highlights and short comings of the work we did.

\section{Conclusion}
Conclude yo.
