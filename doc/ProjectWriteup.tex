\section{Introduction}
Give a quick overview of what we did for our project.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Haiku}
Haikus are three line poems with the second line longer than the other two. In english haikus the lines are measured by the number of syllables. The most common configuration is 5-7-5 in which the first and second lines of the poem have five syllables, and the second line of the poem has seven syllables. Figure \ref{fig:WrightHaiku} uses this structure. Some haikus contain fewer than seventeen syllables, but rarely exceed that amount \cite{Higginson}. \comment{"Need to explain syllables?"}

Due to the constraints of haikus, authors need to be careful in choosing each word. With so few syllables to work with, each word contributes significantly more to the overall meaning of the poem than other poetic forms. Therefore, haikus need to be terse and not use complete sentences. In figure \ref{fig:WrightHaiku} only the second line can be considered a complete sentence.

\subsection{Markov Chains}

Markov chains are a collection of states or variables with an associated collection of probabilities for each state that denotes the chance of going from one state to another. Markov chains can be represented as graphs. In figure \ref{fig:Chain} A, B, and C are nodes that represent the collection of states. The edges represent probabilities. For example, the likeliness of going from state A to state B is 0.25. Note that the edges of each node sum to 1. This is important to maintain because the nonzero edges connect to all possible states that can be achieved from a specific node. This means that in figure \ref{fig:Chain}, if the current state is B, then the possible states that follow are A and C. B cannot follow another B since the probability to itself is zero. \cite{Markov}

\section{Haiku Constraints}
Demonstrate how a haiku can be represented as a constraint problem. For example explain how each word can be represented as a node and a link of nodes with the right number of syllables is a line and three lines makes a haiku.

\section{The Search Space}
Our search space was represented by a Markov chain where each variable is a word and relationships between words are determined by the likelihood that one word is succeeded or proceeded by another. However, in a Haiku we need to know more than just what the word is, we also need to know the sounds it makes, most notably the number of syllables it contains. Unfortunately, neither of us are experts in the English language and after some looking it appears that counting syllables is not an exact science and there are always exceptions to the rules. We implemented a method that accounts for basic English patterns and counts syllables of each word based on these, thus it's not perfect but adequate enough for our work.

To generate these relationships and ultimately the Markov chain, we require that the user provide a text file filled with sentences and phrases that get read in and the relationships between words in that file become the basis for our Markov chain. We treat each line in the input file independently from the previous, meaning that the last word of the first line will not have a relationship with the first word in the second. The parser starts each line by reading the first word and counting its syllables and adding it to the chain the second word is then read in and a connection from the first word to the second word is created and a counter of how many times the relationship appears is incremented. This process then repeats until the entire file has been read and converted to the Markov chain. At this point, instead of probabilities the relations between words has a count of how many times this relationship appears, so for each node in the chain we need to convert these into probabilities by summing the total number of relationships and dividing each count by this sum.

\section{Search Algorithms}
With the search space created the final step in generating a haiku was determining a way to navigate the search space We considered the trivial approach of choosing words at random from the Markov chain and adding them to the haiku where ever they may fit but odds are this would result in a lackluster haiku. Instead we decided to take three different approaches to navigating the space. The first being a slight spin on the trivial approach in that we choose our next word for the haiku from the previous word if possible. The second was a depth first approach in a way that would increase fluidity between words and hopefully generate a haiku that made sense. Finally we implemented a 

\subsection{Naive Search}
The first search method we attempted in our search space was trivial and consisted of picking a starting node in the chain and adding that word to the first available spot in any line of the haiku. The method then chose the next word from the chain as a child of the previous word and added it to any available space in the haiku that would not violate a syllable constraint. If the word could not be added it was ignored and used to generate the next word from it's children. If this approach ever reached a dead end in the chain it would pick a random node from the chain and continue from where it left off.\comment{"Give a one sentence intro about short random walks"}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{$Naive\_Search()$} \label{Naive}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State Choose a random start node and set it to $current$
		\While{Haiku is not full}
			\State if possible, add $current$ to open line in haiku
			\If{$current$ has children}
				\State choose random $child$ from $current$
				\State $current = child$
			\Else
				\State Choose a random node and set it to $current$
			\EndIf
		\EndWhile
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

While this method works for generating valid Haiku's it's rarely any better than throwing random words into a haiku and hoping there is some meaning to the madness. To increase the likelihood that a haiku generated has a connection between each word in the line it is best to force words that are contiguous in the haiku to be connected in the markov chain. We implemented depth first search and a short random walk method to accomplish this.

\subsection{Depth First Search}
One of the methods we used to navigate the search space and generate a Haiku was depth first search with restarts. To accomplish this we utilized a two-way linked list where each node contained a markov node and generated it's child randomly by weighting each of the markov nodes children's probability to generate each line individually. To initialize the search we chose a random markov node from our markov chain and had our root list node point to this node. The algorithm then chose a child node from that markov node and determined how many syllables the line of words would currently have and if we're still within the constraint it would repeat. If we have exactly the number of syllables we needed the code would return the line represented by this linked list starting from the root and ending at the child. If the child we chose would violate our constraints we retreated to the parent and would randomly choose a child that we had not yet visited from this node. If no children we're available we would retreat up another node. Finally if we are at the root node and there are no children available the code would restart and choose a new random starting position in the markov chain.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{$Depth\_First\_Search(n)$} \label{DFSB}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State Choose an random $root$ node from the chain.
		\State $current = root$
		\While {$Syllables \neq n$}
			\If{Have not visited all possible children of $current$}
				\State Choose random unvisited $child$ of $current$
				\If{$child.syllables \leq n$}
					\State $current = child$
				\EndIf
			\Else
				\If{$current == root$}
					\Return $Depth\_First\_Search(n)$
				\Else
					\State $current$ = $parent$ of $current$
				\EndIf
			\EndIf
		\EndWhile
		\Return Line represented by linked list defined by $root$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This approach was then extended to try and maintain fluidity between lines. Instead of generating a random node for the starting position of the line we attempted to use a child of the last node from the previous line. If the child we chose was unable to produce a valid line for the haiku we chose a different child of the previous line's last node. If we had exhausted all the children then the algorithm opted to lose fluidity and generate a random starting node for this line.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{$Depth\_First\_Search(node, n)$} \label{DFSB_WithStart}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State $root = node$
		\State $current = root$
		\While {$Syllables \neq n$}
		\If{Have not visited all possible children of $current$}
		\State Choose random unvisited $child$ of $current$
		\If{$child.syllables \leq n$}
		\State $current = child$
		\EndIf
		\Else
		\If{$current == root$}
			\State {generate new $child$ from the $parent$ of $root$}
			\Return {$Depth\_First\_Search(child, n)$}
		\Else
		\State $current$ = $parent$ of $current$
		\EndIf
		\EndIf
		\EndWhile
		\Return Line represented by linked list defined by $root$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

A final extension of this approach that is currently being implemented is to choose a starting node for the whole haiku and generate the entire haiku using just that node. Some haiku's generated by the previous approach would be valid in this sense but since any line could be restarted with random node not all haiku's would be fluid throughout. This approach would need to be able to regenerate the previous line if the children of the last node cannot generate a new line.
